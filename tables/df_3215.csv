"11.5.2.1.4	 Alcohol consumption 
Data derived from a recent meta-analysis including 15 cross-sectional studies and 16,395 men suggested 
that moderate alcohol does not adversely affect semen parameters, whereas high alcohol intake can have a 
detrimental effect on male fertility [2114]. Similar to what has been reported for weight loss; however, heavy 
chronic alcohol consumption (defined as > 2 drinks/day [2115]) can reduce testosterone levels, which can be 
restored by alcohol cessation [2116].",
