Summary of evidence,LE
The risk of reactivation of latent TB is estimated to be 15% in an individual’s lifetime.,2a
Smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli has a low sensitivity in urine ranging from 0-25%.,2a
"Studies have reported high specificities of 92–100% but low sensitivities of 23.3–30% for urine culture 
in renal TB specimens.",2a
"Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 84.7% (70.8 to 93.1) and 97.3% (91.0 to 99.2) 
for the diagnosis of GUTB.",1b
"Standard six month anti-tuberculous drug regimens are effective in all forms of TB (pulmonary and
