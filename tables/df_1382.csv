Table 4: Epidemiology and pathophysiology overview of male UI [556-560].,,,,
Type,Definition,"Causes and 
associated factors",Pathophysiology,Clinical presentation
"Stress UI: 
prevalence  
< 10%","Urine loss during 
movement or 
efforts or in general 
during increased 
abdominal 
pressure.","• 
Benign Prostatic 
Obstruction 
surgery 
• 
Neurogenic 
condition
• 
Pelvic surgery
• 
Radical 
prostatectomy 
• 
Urethral surgery",Sphincter deficiency,"Symptoms: UI during 
physical activity, 
exercises, e.g. during 
coughing, sneezing, no 
leakage during sleep, 
no nocturnal enuresis
Voiding diary/Pad 
test: with activity
Cough stress test: 
leakage can coincide 
with coughing"
"Urgency UI: 
prevalence 
40-80%","Urine loss 
concomitant 
or immediately 
following an 
urgency episode.","• 
Ageing process
• 
Anorectal 
dysfunction/GI 
disorders
• 
Behavioural 
factors (fluid 
intake and caffeine 
consumption)
• 
Chronic BPO 
• 
Idiopathic 
• 
Intrinsic bladder 
diseases (cystitis, 
fibrosis, interstitial 
cystitis)
• 
Metabolic 
syndrome
• 
Neurogenic 
conditions
• 
UTIs","• 
Detrusor 
overactivity 
(neurogenic or not)
• 
Urothelial 
stimulation 
• 
Increased afferent 
signalling
• 
Others (pelvic 
organ cross talk, 
bladder wall 
ischemia etc.)","Symptoms: urgency, 
usually associated with, 
increased frequency 
and nocturia
Voiding diary: urgency, 
frequency and nocturia"
"Mixed UI: 
prevalence 
10-30%","Any combination 
of SUI and UUI.","Causes of both SIU 
and UUI","Combination of SUI 
and UUI","Symptoms: UI equally 
as often with physical 
activity as with a sense 
of urgency
Voiding diary: varies
Cough stress test: 
may show leakage with 
coughing"
Summary of evidence,LE,,,
"Validated specific symptom score questionnaires and voiding diaries assist in the screening for and 
categorisation of UI.",3,,,
"Pad test can be used to quantify the presence and severity of UI, as well as a patient’s response to 
treatment.",3,,,
"There is limited evidence that urodynamics and PVR affect treatment choice in men with 
uncomplicated UI.",3,,,
Recommendation,Strength rating,,,
"Take a complete medical history including symptoms and co-morbidities, medications, and 
a focused physical examination in the evaluation of men with urinary incontinence (UI).",Strong,,,
"Use a validated symptom score questionnaire, bladder diary and pad-test to assess UI.",Strong,,,
Measure post-void residual in the assessment of UI.,Strong,,,
Perform urodynamics for UI when considering invasive treatment.,Weak,,,
