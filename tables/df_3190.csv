Surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile shortness
Current literature reports a wide spectrum of possible surgical interventions aimed to address penile 
shortness. Nonetheless, the proposed spectrum of surgical interventions starts from less invasive procedures 
- such as suspensory ligament release (SLR) - to more complex genital reconstruction - such as total phallic 
reconstruction (TPR) [1493, 1494]. These issues make the surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile 
shortness a surgical challenge in urology.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Various surgical procedures may be considered to restore genital anatomy in AABP patients.,3
"Acquired adult buried penis surgery is burdened by a significant incidence of postoperative 
complications.",3
"Lifestyle changes and risk factor modifications, particularly weight loss, are widely considered as a 
proactive approach to minimise AABP surgical complications.",4
"Acquired adult buried penis surgery may provide satisfactory functional outcomes with a low 
incidence of recurrence.",3
