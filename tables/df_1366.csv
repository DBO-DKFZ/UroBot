"5.6.3.1.3	 Constipation
One RCT, with a majority female population, found that a multimodal intervention in elderly patients, involving 
assisted toileting, fluid intake, etc., reduced the occurrence of UI and constipation, while behavioural therapy 
appeared to improve both [573]. However, there is no evidence to show whether treating constipation improves 
UI, although both constipation and UI appear to be improved by certain behavioural interventions.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"There is limited evidence that lifestyle interventions e.g., weight reduction, smoking cessation or diet 
modification improves UI in males.",3
"There is limited evidence that improving co-morbidities or changing drug regimens for underlying 
disease improves UI in males.",3
Pads and/or penile sheaths are palliative options for management of UI.,1b
