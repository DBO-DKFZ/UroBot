Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of neurogenic bladder",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Neurogenic detrusor-sphincter dysfunction (NDSD) may result in different forms of LUTD and 
ultimately result in incontinence, UTIs, VUR, and renal scarring.",2a
"In children, the most common cause of NDSD is myelodysplasia (a group of developmental anomalies 
that result from defects in neural tube closure).",2
"Bladder sphincter dysfunction correlates poorly with the type and level of the spinal cord lesion. 
Therefore, urodynamic and functional classifications are more practical in defining the extent of the 
pathology and in guiding treatment planning.",2a
"Children with neurogenic bladder can have disturbances of bowel function as well as urinary function 
which require monitoring and, if needed, management.",2a
"The main goals of treatment are prevention of urinary tract deterioration and achievement of 
continence at an appropriate age.",2a
"Injection of botulinum toxin into the detrusor muscle in children who are refractory to anticholinergics, 
has been shown to have beneficial effects on clinical and urodynamic variables.",2a
