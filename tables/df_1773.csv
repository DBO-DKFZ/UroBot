3.19.2.9  Summary of evidence and recommendations for papillary tumours of the bladder in children,,
Summary of evidence,LE,
Majority of paediatric patients have no identifiable risk factors for bladder tumours.,3,
There is no evidence on intravesical therapy for bladder tumours in children and adolescents.,4,
Prognosis of papillary tumours of the bladder in children is good overall.,3,
Inflammatory myofibroblastic bladder tumours are usually benign.,3,
"Paediatric EC cases are in a third of cases associated with a history of allergic conditions and in 50% 
with significant eosinophilia or eosinophiluria.",4,
"Paediatric EC patients usually present with irritative and or obstructive urinary symptoms which can 
mimic UTI or LUTS thereby leading to delayed diagnosis.",4,
In paediatric EC definitive diagnosis can only be attained on tissue biopsy obtained by cystoscopy.,4,
"In EC treatment with corticosteroids, antibiotics, anticholinergics, and antihistamines, in addition to 
cyclosporine A have been utilised and lead to resolution of symptoms in most cases.",4,
"No standard follow-up recommendations exist however surveillance is justified as recurrence has 
been reported in about a third of patients.",4,
"NA in children are rare benign lesions that usually occur in the setting of previous surgery or chronic 
irritation of urinary tract and mainly occurring in the bladder.",4,
"NA usually presents with haematuria and or storage LUTS and with a papillary/polypoid mass on seen 
on cystoscopy.",4,
NA diagnosis is established by cystoscopy and histopathological review of biopsy specimen.,4,
"NA treatment is excision either by transurethral resection which often requires reresections, partial 
cystectomy or open excision.",4,
NA recurrence rate is high thereby justifying regular follow-up.,4,
Recommendations,LE,Strength rating
"Ultrasound is the first investigation of choice for the diagnosis of paediatric bladder 
tumours.",3,Strong
"Cystoscopy should be reserved if a bladder tumour is suspected on imaging for 
diagnosis and treatment.",3,Strong
"After histological confirmation, inflammatory myofibroblastic bladder tumours should 
be resected locally.",4,Weak
"Follow-up should be every three to six months in the first year, and thereafter at least.",4,Strong
annually with urinanalysis and an ultrasound for at least five years.,4,Strong
"Have a high index of suspicion of eosinophilic cystitis (EC) in protracted urinary tract 
symptoms unresponsive to regular treatment.",4,Weak
Remove any possible allergens as the obvious first step in managing EC.,4,Strong
"Eosinophilic cystitis can be managed medically with corticosteroids, antibiotics, 
anticholinergics, and antihistamines, in addition to cyclosporine A.",4,Weak
"Manage nephrogenic adenoma (NA) by resection either transuretherally or by open 
excision.",4,Strong
Regular endoscopic follow-up especially for augmented patients with NA is justified.,4,Weak
