"6.3.5.2.1.2	Endoluminal treatment after failed urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis
In case of a non-obliterative and short (< 1 cm) recurrence after failed urethroplasty, endoluminal treatment can 
be performed [437]. Although a 1st and 2nd DVIU can be successful with a stricture-free rate of 22.9-77.3% and 
0-60% respectively, three or more incisions are never successful (see supplementary Table S6.16) [437-440]. 
Therefore, repetitive endoluminal treatments (dilations and/or endoscopic incisions) can only be considered as 
a palliative option [441].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Perform open reconstruction for post-traumatic posterior stenosis only in high-volume 
centres.",Weak
"Perform progressive perineal excision and primary anastomosis (EPA) for obliterative 
stenosis.",Strong
"Perform progressive perineal EPA for non-obliterative stenosis after failed endoluminal 
treatment.",Strong
Perform a midline perineal incision to gain access to the posterior urethra.,Strong
