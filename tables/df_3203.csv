"10.2.1.4.8	 Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors
Low doses of PDE5Is have a paradoxical effect in alleviating and preventing stuttering priapism; mainly in 
patients with idiopathic and SCD-associated priapism [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694-1698] (LE: 3). It is important to 
remember that therapy should be started when the penis is in its flaccid state and not during an acute episode. 
There is a delay of one week before treatment is effective. There are no reported impairments in male sexual 
function (LE: 3). Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor treatment of stuttering priapism is possibly mediated by 
an increase in the concentration of cGMP in the smooth muscle in an NO dysfunctional state. This can occur 
in priapism and may result in a change in the NO pathway, with down-regulation of cavernosal PDE5 thereby 
preventing the complete degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Manage each acute episode similar to that for ischaemic priapism.,Strong
"Use hormonal therapies (mainly gonadotropin-receptor hormone agonists or antagonists) 
and/or anti-androgens for the prevention of future episodes in patients with frequent 
relapses. Do not use them before sexual maturation is reached.",Weak
"Initiate treatment with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors only when the penis is in its 
flaccid state.",Weak
"Use digoxin, α-adrenergic agonists, baclofen, gabapentin or terbutaline only in patients with 
frequent and uncontrolled relapses.",Weak
"Use intracavernous self-injections of sympathomimetic drugs at home for treatment of 
acute episodes on an interim basis until ischaemic priapism has been alleviated.",Weak
