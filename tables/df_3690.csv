Anastomotic urethroplasty in men with penile urethral strictures
Historically, the use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been 
discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively [263, 284]. Nevertheless, it has been performed in 
selected patients with very short strictures (usually < 1 cm) with 80-93% patency rate, with satisfactory QoL 
and sexual function and without any case of chordee [285] and with results comparable to augmentation 
urethroplasty [286].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer men with penile urethral stricture disease augmentation urethroplasty by either a 
single-stage or staged approach taking into consideration previous interventions and 
stricture characteristics.",Strong
"Offer an interval of at least four to six months before proceeding to the second stage of the 
procedure provided that outcome of the first stage is satisfactory.",Weak
"Do not offer anastomotic urethroplasty to patients with penile strictures > 1 cm due to the 
risk of penile chordee post-operatively.",Strong
"Counsel patients with penile strictures that single-stage procedures might be converted to 
staged ones in the face of adverse intra-operative findings.",Strong
