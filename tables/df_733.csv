"Patients with high-risk and those with very high-risk tumours treated conservatively should 
undergo cystoscopy and urinary cytology at 3 months. If negative, subsequent cystoscopy 
and cytology should be repeated every 3 months for a period of 2 years, and every 6 
months thereafter until 5 years, and then yearly.",Weak,,,,,,,,
"Patients with intermediate-risk Ta tumours should have an in-between (individualised) 
follow-up scheme using cystoscopy.",Weak,,,,,,,,
"Regular (yearly) upper tract imaging (computed tomography-intravenous urography [CT-IVU] 
or IVU) is recommended for high-risk and very high-risk tumours.",Weak,,,,,,,,
"Perform endoscopy under anaesthesia and bladder biopsies when office cystoscopy shows 
suspicious findings or if urinary cytology is positive.",Strong,,,,,,,,
"During follow-up in patients with positive cytology and no visible tumour in the bladder, 
mapping biopsies or PDD-guided biopsies (if equipment is available) and investigation of 
extravesical locations (CT urography, prostatic urethra biopsy) are recommended.",Strong,,,,,,,,
