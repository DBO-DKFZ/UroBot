Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of urinary fistula",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Spontaneous closure of surgical fistulae does occur and appears more likely for small fistulae although 
it is not possible to establish the rate with any certainty.",3
"There is no evidence that the timing of repair makes a difference to the chances of successful closure 
of a fistula.",3
"There is no high-quality evidence of differing success rates for repair of VVFs by vaginal, abdominal, 
transvesical, and transperitoneal approaches.",3
"A variety of interpositional grafts can be used in either abdominal or vaginal procedures, although 
there is little evidence to support their benefits in any specific setting.",3
Post-radiation fistula,
"Success rates are lower for irradiated fistulae than for non-radiated fistulae.
3",
Ureteric fistula,
"Prophylactic ureteric stent insertion does not reduce risk of ureteric injury during gynaecological 
2
surgery.",
"Antegrade endoluminal distal ureteric occlusion combined with nephrostomy tube diversion often 
4
palliates urinary leakage due to malignant fistula in the terminal phase.",
Urethro-vaginal fistula,
"Urethro-vaginal fistula repair may be complicated by SUI, urethral stricture, and urethral shortening, 
3
which may necessitate long-term follow-up.",
