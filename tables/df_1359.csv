Diode laser enucleation of the prostate
Mechanism of action: For prostate surgery, diode lasers with a wavelength of 940, 980, 1,318, and 1,470 nm 
(depending on the semiconductor used) are marketed for vaporisation and enucleation. Only a few have been 
evaluated in clinical trials [385].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Prostatic artery embolisation (PAE) is less effective than TURP at improving symptoms and 
urodynamic parameters such as flow rate.",1a
"Procedural time is longer for PAE compared to TURP, but blood loss, catheterisation and 
hospitalisation time are in favour of PAE.",1b
