Table 32:  Classification of the clinical conditions underlying a short penis condition or dysmorphophobia,,,,
Summary of evidence,LE,,,
"There is a difference between true micropenis (anatomical-endocrinological)/short penis (complaint)/
buried penis (complaint short penis + obesity) (panel consensus). Small penis anxiety/syndrome refers 
to a man’s excessive anxiety regarding his normal-sized penis.",4,,,
"A true micropenis is a congenital condition where the SPL is 2.5 SD cm less than the average length 
for age of the population group and is the result of an underlying genetic or endocrine condition.",3,,,
"A buried penis is a normal sized penis where there is functional and visible loss of penile length due to 
an underlying pathological condition such as obesity or traumatic loss of length. The penis is covered 
by prepubic, scrotal or penile subcutaneous tissue or skin.",3,,,
"Penile Dysmorphic Disorder is a shorthand concept applied to Body Dysmorphic Disorder cases 
characterised by a strong focus on a perceived deficiency or flaw in a normal size or shape penis, 
resulting in mental health impairment and significant damage in important areas of the individual’s life.",3,,,
