4.2.4.3.2.5.1	Summary of evidence and recommendations for mid-urethral slings,
Summary of evidence,LE
"The retropubic MUS appears to provide better patient-reported subjective and objective cure of SUI, 
compared with colposuspension.",1a
"Synthetic MUSs inserted by the transobturator or retropubic route provide equivalent patient-reported 
outcomes at one year.",1a
"Synthetic MUSs inserted by the retropubic route have higher patient-reported cure rates in the longer 
term.",1b
Long-term analyses of MUS cohorts showed a sustained response beyond 10 years.,2b
"The retropubic route of insertion, compared with the transobturator route, is associated with a higher 
intraoperative risk of bladder perforation and a higher rate of voiding dysfunction.",1a
"The transobturator route of insertion is associated with a higher risk of groin pain than the retropubic 
route.",1a
"Long-term analysis of MUS showed no difference in terms of efficacy for the skin-to-vagina (outside-
in) compared to vagina-to-skin (inside-out) directions up to nine years.",2a
"The top-to-bottom (inside-out) direction in the retropubic approach is associated with a higher risk of 
postoperative voiding dysfunction.",1b
"The comparative efficacy of Ajust® and Altis® single-incision slings against conventional MUS at 
fifteen and 36 months is non-inferior.",1b
Operating times for insertion of single-incision MUSs are shorter than for standard retropubic slings.,1b
"Blood loss and immediate postoperative pain are lower for insertion of single-incision slings compared 
with conventional MUS.",1b
"The rate of mesh exposure, repeat SUI surgery and dyspareunia at 3 years is higher for single-incision 
slings (Ajust® and Alits®) compared to conventional MUS.",1b
"There is no evidence that other adverse outcomes from surgery are more or less likely with single-
incision slings than with conventional MUS.",1b
"In women undergoing surgery for SUI, coital incontinence is likely to improve.",3
"Overall, there is conflicting evidence regarding sexual function following SUI surgery.",1a
