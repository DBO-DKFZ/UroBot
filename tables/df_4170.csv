Strength rating",
Diagnosis,
"Take a full medical history including history of previous tuberculosis infection (pulmonary 
and extrapulmonary) form all patients presenting with persistent non-specific genitourinary 
symptoms and no identifiable cause.",Strong
"Perform smear microscopy on urine, semen, tissue specimens, discharged or prostatic 
massage fluid using Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) or auramine staining in patients with suspected 
genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB).",Weak
"Perform acid-fact bacilli culture on three midstream first-void urine samples, on three 
consecutive days for M. tuberculosis isolation in patients with suspected GUTB.",Strong
"Use a recommended PCR test system in addition to microbiological reference standard 
(MRS) in urine specimens as a diagnostic test in patients with signs and symptoms of 
GUTB.",Weak
"Use imaging modalities in combination with culture and/or PCR to aid in the diagnosis of 
GUTB and to assess the location and extent of damage to the genitourinary system.",Weak
Treatment,
Use medical treatment as first-line treatment for GUTB.,Strong
"Use a daily six-month regimen for treatment of newly diagnosed GUTB this should include 
an intensive phase of two months with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. 
Followed by a continuation phase of four-months with isoniazid and rifampicin.",Strong
