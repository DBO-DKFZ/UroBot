4.2.4.3.2.5.1  Summary of evidence and recommendations for mid-urethral slings,
Summary of evidence,LE
"The retropubic MUS appears to provide better patient-reported subjective and objective cure of SUI, 
compared with colposuspension.",1a
"Synthetic MUSs inserted by the transobturator or retropubic route provide equivalent patient-reported 
outcomes at one year.",1a
"Synthetic MUSs inserted by the retropubic route have higher patient-reported cure rates in the longer 
term.",1b
Long-term analyses of MUS cohorts showed a sustained response beyond 10 years.,2b
"The retropubic route of insertion, compared with the transobturator route, is associated with a higher 
intraoperative risk of bladder perforation and a higher rate of voiding dysfunction.",1a
"The transobturator route of insertion is associated with a higher risk of groin pain than the retropubic 
route.",1a
"Long-term analysis of MUS showed no difference in terms of efficacy for the skin-to-vagina (outside-
in) compared to vagina-to-skin (inside-out) directions up to nine years.",2a
"The top-to-bottom (inside-out) direction in the retropubic approach is associated with a higher risk of 
postoperative voiding dysfunction.",1b
"The comparative efficacy of Ajust® and Altis® single-incision slings against conventional MUS at 
fifteen and 36 months is non-inferior.",1b
Operating times for insertion of single-incision MUSs are shorter than for standard retropubic slings.,1b
"Blood loss and immediate postoperative pain are lower for insertion of single-incision slings compared 
with conventional MUS.",1b
"The rate of mesh exposure, repeat SUI surgery and dyspareunia at 3 years is higher for single-incision 
slings (Ajust® and Alits®) compared to conventional MUS.",1b
"There is no evidence that other adverse outcomes from surgery are more or less likely with single-
incision slings than with conventional MUS.",1b
"In women undergoing surgery for SUI, coital incontinence is likely to improve.",3
"Overall, there is conflicting evidence regarding sexual function following SUI surgery.",1a
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer a mid-urethral sling (MUS) to women seeking surgical treatment for stress urinary 
incontinence following a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits relative to other 
surgical modalities.",Strong
"Inform women that long-term outcomes from MUS inserted by the retropubic route are 
superior to those inserted via the transobturator route.",Strong
"Inform women of the complications associated with MUS procedures and discuss all 
alternative treatments in the light of recent publicity surrounding surgical mesh.",Strong
"Inform women who are being offered single-incision slings (Ajust® and Altis®), that short 
term efficacy appears equivalent compared to conventional MUS.",Strong
"Inform women who are being offered a single-incision sling that long-term efficacy remains 
uncertain.",Strong
