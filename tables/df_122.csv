"6.4.1.2	
Adjuvant chemotherapy 
There are known poor prognostic characteristics for a subset of patients with resected high-risk disease (such 
as involved pelvic LNs), indicating the likely presence of micrometastatic disease. Data exists on response 
rates for those with metastatic disease and there is possible benefit for pre-operative chemotherapy for those 
with unresectable locally advanced disease as described above. With extrapolation from other diseases, it 
stands to reason that systemic therapy following resection (i.e., adjuvant therapy) may improve outcomes.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Results support the activity of NAC in patients with clinically involved regional LNs from penile SCC. 
However, randomised studies are lacking, and substantial concerns remain regarding the selection of 
patients who are best suited for a systemic therapy approach upfront.",2b
"The available evidence favours a cisplatin- and taxane-based combination (doublet or triplet) as the 
preferred approach.",2b
"Limited data support the use of adjuvant chemotherapy to improve OS following surgical resection. 
However, it could be offered to patients with pN3 disease post-LND if NAC has not been received, 
upon careful consideration of risks and benefits with the patient.",4
