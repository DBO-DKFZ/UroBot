"4.1.1.1	
Anxiety, depression, and overall function
Distress is best understood in the context of pain and of the meaning of pain to the individual and is 
best assessed ideographically rather than normatively. Almost all diagnostic measures and standardised 
instruments of anxiety and depression are designed for people without significant physical problems, so are 
difficult to interpret in chronic pelvic pain [235].",

"All of those involved in the management of chronic pelvic pain should have knowledge of 
peripheral and central pain mechanisms.",Strong

effect on work and socialisation, early in patients with chronic pelvic pain and address these 
issues as well as the pain.",Strong
"Build up relations with colleagues so as to be able to manage CPPPS comprehensively in a
