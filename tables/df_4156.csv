Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnosis of bacterial prostatitis",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Urine dipstick testing for nitrite and leukocytes has a positive predictive value of 95% and a negative 
predictive value of 70% in patients with ABP.",3
"The four-glass Meares and Stamey test is the optimum test for diagnosis of CBP. The two-glass test 
has been shown to offer similar diagnostic sensitivity in a comparison study.",2b
"First-void urine is the preferred specimen for the diagnosis of urogenital C. trachomatis infection in 
men by NAATs.",2b
Transrectal ultrasound is unreliable and cannot be used as a diagnostic tool in prostatitis.,3
"Semen culture sensitivity is reported to be approximately 50%; therefore, it is not routinely part of the 
diagnostic assessment of CBP.",3
"Prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated during active prostatitis; therefore, PSA testing 
should be avoided as it offers no practical diagnostic information for prostatitis.",3
