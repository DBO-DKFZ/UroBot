"4.7.4.5	
Vaginal pelvic organ prolapse surgery in continent women
One RCT compared vaginal POP surgery alone with concomitant POP surgery and MUS in 220 women. 
Postoperative SUI occurred in 46/113 (40.7%) women who had POP surgery alone, compared to 30/107 
(28.0%) who had additional MUS (RR: 0.69) [656]."
