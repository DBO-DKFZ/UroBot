Diagnosis
Blood analysis requires measurement of creatinine, and urinalysis requires repeat urine pH measurements and 
urine culture. In cases of mixed struvite stones the search of metabolic abnormalities in 24 hour urine after 
stone removal and infection control is suggested.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Increasing fluid intake so that 24-hour urine volume exceeds 3 L is used to dilute the cystine.,3
Alkaline citrates 3-10 mmol two or three times daily can be used to achieve pH > 7.5.,3
"Tiopronin, 250-2,000 mg/day can be used to reduce stone formation in patients with cystine excretion, 
> 3 mmol/day, or when other measures are insufficient.",3
