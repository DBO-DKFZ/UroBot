6.2.2.1	
Modalities of dilatation and results
Dilatation can be done in the office, under local anaesthesia and without complex resources [223, 224]. With 
dilatation, the urethral mucosa at the stricture site is stretched and the scarring is disrupted. This is opposed 
to DVIU where the stricture is incised. However, both treatment modalities use the same principle to achieve 
urethral patency: a breach of the urethral mucosa at the site of the stricture in which re-epithelialisation should 
occur faster than wound contraction [220].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Do not use direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) for penile strictures.,Strong
Do not use DVIU/dilatation as solitary treatment for long (> 2 cm) segment strictures.,Strong
"Perform DVIU/dilatation for a primary, single, short (< 2 cm) and non-obliterative stricture at 
the bulbar urethra.",Weak
"Perform DVIU/dilatation for a short, veil-like recurrent stricture after prior bulbar 
urethroplasty.",Weak
"Use either “hot” or “cold knife” techniques to perform DVIU depending on operator 
experience and resources.",Weak
