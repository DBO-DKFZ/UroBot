Table 2:  Chronic Primary Pelvic Pain Syndromes (the term primary can be included in any of the,
Urological Pain Syndromes,
"Primary prostate 
pain syndrome","Primary prostate pain syndrome (PPPS) is the occurrence of persistent or recurrent 
episodic pain (which is convincingly reproduced by prostate palpation). There is no 
proven infection or other obvious local pathology. Primary prostate pain syndrome 
is often associated with negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual or emotional 
consequences, as well as with symptoms suggestive of lower urinary tract and sexual 
dysfunction. The term “chronic prostatitis” continues to be equated with that of 
PPPS. In the authors’ and others’ opinion, this is an inappropriate term, although it 
is recognised that it has a long history of use. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
consensus [15] includes infection (types I and II), which the authors feel should not 
be considered under PPPS, but as specific disease-associated pelvic pain. The term 
prostadynia has also been used in the past but is no longer recommended by the 
expert panel. Please note that some of the authors of the IASP document disagree with 
this term and suggest that CPPPS of the male is used instead of PPPS, which has been 
agreed by the majority."
"Primary bladder 
pain syndrome","Primary bladder pain syndrome is the occurrence of persistent or recurrent pain 
perceived in the urinary bladder region, accompanied by at least one other symptom, 
such as pain worsening with bladder filling and day-time and/or night-time urinary 
frequency. There is no proven infection or other obvious local pathology. Primary 
bladder pain syndrome is often associated with negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual 
or emotional consequences, as well as with symptoms suggestive of lower urinary 
tract and sexual dysfunction. PBPS is believed to represent a heterogeneous spectrum 
of disorders. There may be specific types of inflammation as a feature in subsets of 
patients. Localisation of the pain can be difficult by examination, and consequently, 
another localising symptom is required. Cystoscopy with hydrodistension and biopsy 
may be indicated to define phenotypes. Recently, ESSIC has suggested a standardised 
scheme of sub-classifications [16] to acknowledge differences and make it easier to 
compare various studies. Other terms that have been used include “interstitial cystitis”, 
“painful bladder syndrome”, and “PBS/IC” or “BPS/IC”. These terms are no longer 
recommended."
"Primary scrotal 
pain syndrome","Primary scrotal pain syndrome is the occurrence of persistent or recurrent episodic 
pain localised to the scrotum or the structure within it and may be associated with 
symptoms suggestive of lower urinary tract or sexual dysfunction. There is no proven 
infection or other obvious local pathology. Primary scrotal pain syndrome is often 
associated with negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences. 
Primary scrotal pain syndrome is a generic term and is used when the site of the pain is 
not clearly testicular or epididymal. The pain is not in the skin of the scrotum as such, 
but perceived within its contents, in a similar way to idiopathic chest pain."
"Primary testicular 
pain syndrome","Primary testicular pain syndrome is the occurrence of persistent or recurrent episodic 
pain perceived in the testes, and may be associated with symptoms suggestive of 
lower urinary tract or sexual dysfunction. There is no proven infection or other obvious 
local pathology. Primary testicular pain syndrome is often associated with negative 
cognitive, behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences. Previous terms have 
included orchitis, orchialgia and orchiodynia. These terms are no longer recommended"
"Primary epididymal 
pain syndrome","Primary epididymal pain syndrome is the occurrence of persistent or recurrent episodic 
pain perceived in the epididymis, and may be associated with symptoms suggestive of 
lower urinary tract or sexual dysfunction. There is no proven infection or other obvious 
local pathology. Primary epididymal pain syndrome is often associated with negative 
cognitive, behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences."
"Primary penile  
pain syndrome","Primary penile pain syndrome is the occurrence of pain within the penis that is not 
primarily in the urethra, in the absence of proven infection or other obvious local 
pathology. Primary penile pain syndrome is often associated with negative cognitive, 
behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences, as well as with symptoms suggestive 
of lower urinary tract and sexual dysfunction."
"Primary urethral 
pain syndrome","Primary urethral pain syndrome is the occurrence of chronic or recurrent episodic 
pain perceived in the urethra, in the absence of proven infection or other obvious local 
pathology. Primary urethral pain syndrome is often associated with negative cognitive, 
behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences, as well as with symptoms suggestive 
of lower urinary tract, sexual, bowel or gynaecological dysfunction. Primary urethral 
pain syndrome may occur in men and women."
"Post-vasectomy
scrotal pain
syndrome","Post-vasectomy scrotal pain syndrome is a scrotal pain syndrome that follows 
vasectomy. Post-vasectomy scrotal pain syndrome is often associated with negative 
cognitive, behavioural, sexual or emotional consequences, as well as with symptoms 
suggestive of lower urinary tract and sexual dysfunction. Post-vasectomy pain may 
be as frequent as 1% following vasectomy, possibly more frequent. The mechanisms 
are poorly understood and for that reason it is considered by some a special form of 
primary scrotal pain syndrome."
