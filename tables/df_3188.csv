Counselling and outcomes assessment - Validated questionnaires
The Augmentation Phalloplasty Patient Selection and Satisfaction Inventory (APPSSI) questionnaire is a 5-item 
questionnaire proposed for the assessment and counselling about penile augmentation surgical treatment 
[1465]. The Beliefs about Penis Size (BAPS) is a 10-item questionnaire created for audit and outcome research 
to assess men’s beliefs about penile size [1464]. Both questionnaires have failed to correlate with penile size 
and lack of objective validation has restricted their use.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Psychotherapy should not be undertaken in the realm of preventing individuals’ legitimate choice 
to improve their lives. Conversely, psychotherapy is recommended when psychopathological 
comorbidities are detected, or when aversive relationship dynamics may underlie the request for 
penile augmentation.",3
Cognitive behaviour therapy for BDD could be applied to cases of anxiety regarding penis size.,3
Penile traction therapy proved to be an effective treatment to achieve penile lengthening.,3
Vacuum erection devices proved to be an ineffective treatment in achieving penile lengthening.,3

hypogonadism.",3
