Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic assessment of RCC",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Use multi-phasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and chest for 
the diagnosis and staging of renal tumours.",Strong
"Omit chest CT in patients with incidentally noted cT1a disease due to the low risk of lung 
metastases in this cohort.",Weak
"Use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to better evaluate venous involvement, reduce 
radiation or avoid intravenous CT contrast medium.",Weak
"Use non-ionising modalities, including MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, for further 
characterisation of small renal masses, tumour thrombus and differentiation of unclear renal 
masses, in case the results of contrast-enhanced CT are indeterminate.",Strong
"Offer brain CT/MRI in metastatic patients when systemic therapy or cytoreductive 
nephrectomy is considered.",Weak
"Do not routinely use bone scan and/or positron-emission tomography CT for staging of 
renal cell carcinoma.",Weak
"Perform a renal tumour biopsy before ablative therapy and systemic therapy without 
previous pathology.",Strong
Perform a percutaneous biopsy in select patients who are considering active surveillance.,Weak
Use a coaxial technique when performing a renal tumour biopsy.,Strong
"Do not perform a renal tumour biopsy of cystic renal masses unless a significant solid 
component is visible at imaging.",Strong
"Use a core biopsy technique rather than fine needle aspiration for histological 
characterisation of solid renal tumours.",Strong
