Complications
There is limited data available regarding the reporting of complications from PLND. This is complicated by the 
fact that most patients will have already undergone a rILND which carries a significant morbidity as discussed 
above. A single-centre experience of 89 patients, undergoing open PLND for penile cancer reported an overall 
complication rate of 18%. Nine patients had wound complications including infection, seroma, and dehiscence. 
The remaining 5 patients had non-wound-related complications such as pneumonia, delirium, and ileus [251].",
