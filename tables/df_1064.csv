"4.2.4.2.2	 Duloxetine
Duloxetine inhibits the presynaptic reuptake of neurotransmitters, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and 
noradrenaline (NE). 
In the sacral spinal cord, an increased concentration of 5-HT and NE in the synaptic cleft increases 
stimulation of 5-HT and NE receptors on the pudendal motor neurons, which in turn increases the resting tone 
and contraction strength of the urethral striated sphincter.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Duloxetine improves SUI in women, but the chances of cure are low.",1a
"Duloxetine may cause significant gastrointestinal and central nervous system adverse effects, leading 
to a high rate of treatment discontinuation, although these symptoms may be limited to the first weeks 
of treatment.",1a
