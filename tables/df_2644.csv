Is there a role for dopaminergic drugs, furosemide or mannitol in renal transplantation?
Low-dose dopamine (LDD) has been used in renal transplantation due to a perceived improvement in urine 
output and early graft function. Use of LDD in kidney donors is outside of the scope of this section. Conflicting 
results prevent a consensus statement on routine use of LDD in transplant recipients. A small (n=20) prospective 
randomised cross-over study in deceased donor renal transplantation suggested significant improvements in 
urine output and creatinine clearance in the first nine hours post-surgery without adverse events [98]. By contrast, 
a retrospective comparison of LDD in the first twelve hours post-deceased donor renal transplantation showed 
no difference in diuresis or kidney function, but those administered LDD (n=57) had increased heart rates, longer 
intensive therapy unit stay and higher six-month mortality than those not treated with LDD (n=48) [99].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"A retrospective comparative study of LDD treated vs. non-treated renal transplantation patients 
concluded that LDD administration did not improve kidney function in the first twelve hours post renal 
transplantation, but did result in increased heart rates, longer intensive therapy unit stay and higher 
six-month mortality in those receiving LDD.",2b
