4.4.4.4.1  Summary of evidence and recommendations for underactive bladder,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Abdominal straining with relaxation of the PFM may improve bladder emptying but increases the risk 
of POP.",3
"Pelvic floor muscle relaxation training may increase voiding episodes, decrease post-void residual 
volume and voiding time.",3
"Clean intermittent self-catheterisation has proven efficacy in terms of effecting bladder emptying in 
patients who are unable to do so.",3
"Indwelling transurethral catheterisation and suprapubic cystostomy are associated with a range of 
complications as well as an increased risk of UTI.",3
"Intravesical electrical stimulation may be useful in some patients after prolonged bladder over-
distension, but long-term efficacy remains unproven.",3
"Parasympathomimetics do not improve clinical or urodynamic parameters of UAB and frequent and/or 
serious adverse effects may arise.",1b
"Alpha-adrenergic blockers in women with UAB may be effective in improving voided volume and 
reducing PVR volume.",2b
"Very low certainty evidence indicates that intravesical prostaglandins may promote successful voiding 
in patients with urinary retention after surgery.",1a
Sacral nerve stimulation improves voided volume and decreases PVR volume in women with DU.,1b
"There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA external urethral sphincter 
injections to improve voiding in women with UAB.",3
"Transurethral bladder neck incision may improve voiding in women with DU, but complications (SUI, 
vesico-vaginal fistulae) may occur.",3
There is very limited evidence for the effectiveness of detrusor myoplasty for bladder acontractility.,3
Recommendations,Strength rating
Encourage double voiding in those women who are unable to completely empty their bladder.,Weak
"Warn women with underactive bladder (UAB) who use abdominal straining to improve 
emptying about pelvic organ prolapse risk.",Weak
"Use clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) as a standard treatment in patients who 
are unable to empty their bladder.",Strong
Thoroughly instruct patients in the technique and risks of CISC.,Strong
"Offer indwelling transurethral catheterisation and suprapubic cystostomy only when other 
modalities for urinary drainage have failed or are unsuitable.",Weak
Do not routinely recommend intravesical electrical stimulation in women with UAB.,Weak
Do not routinely recommend parasympathomimetics for treatment of women with UAB.,Strong
Offer alpha-adrenergic blockers before more-invasive techniques.,Weak
"Offer intravesical prostaglandins to women with urinary retention after surgery only in the 
context of well-regulated clinical trials.",Weak
"Offer onabotulinumtoxinA external sphincter injections before more-invasive techniques as 
long as patients are informed that the evidence to support this treatment is of low quality.",Weak
Offer sacral nerve stimulation to women with UAB refractory to conservative treatment.,Strong
Do not routinely offer detrusor myoplasty as a treatment for DU.,Weak
