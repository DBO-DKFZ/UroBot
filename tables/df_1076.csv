4.2.4.3.4.1	Stress urinary incontinence surgery in obese women
There is no agreement about the outcome of incontinence surgery in obese women. Secondary analysis of an RCT 
on retropubic and transobturator tapes for treatment of women with SUI suggests that obese women experience 
inferior outcome compared to non-obese women. Stratification of patients according to BMI (< 30 and > 30) shows 
a significant difference in objective dry rates (negative pad test) at one year (85.6% vs. 67.8%) and five years 
(87.4% vs. 65.9%) and subjective cure (absence of SUI symptoms) at one year (85.8% vs. 70.7%) and five 
years (76.7% vs. 53.6%). At one and five years, 6.7% and 16.3% of patients who were initially dry (negative 
pad test) after surgery developed a positive pad test [426, 427].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Implantation of an artificial sphincter improves or cures incontinence in women with SUI caused by 
sphincter insufficiency.",3
Implantation of the AUS device may improve complicated SUI.,3
Implantation of the ACT® device may improve complicated SUI.,3
"Complications, mechanical failure, and device explantation often occur with both the artificial 
sphincter and ACT®.",3
"Explantation of AUS is more frequent in older women and among those who have had previous Burch 
colposuspension or pelvic radiotherapy.",3
