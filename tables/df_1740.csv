Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of neurogenic bladder",,
Recommendations,LE,Strength rating
"Urodynamic studies should be performed in every patient with spina bifida as well 
as in every child with high suspicion of a neurogenic bladder to estimate the risk 
for the upper urinary tract and to evaluate the function of the detrusor and the 
sphincter.",2,Strong
"In all newborns, intermittent catheterisation (IC) should be started soon after birth. 
In those with a clear underactive sphincter and no overactivity, starting IC may be 
delayed. If IC is delayed, closely monitor babies for urinary tract infections, upper 
tract changes (ultrasound) and the lower tract (urodynamics).",3,Strong
"Start early anticholinergic medication in the newborns with suspicion of an 
overactive detrusor.",2,Strong
"The use of suburothelial or intradetrusoral injection of onabotulinum toxin A 
is an alternative and a less invasive option in children who are refractory to 
anticholinergics in contrast to bladder augmentation.",2,Strong
"Treatment of faecal incontinence is important to gain continence and independence. 
Treatment should be started with mild laxatives, rectal suppositories as well as 
digital stimulation. If not sufficient transanal irrigation is recommended, if not 
practicable or feasible, a Malone antegrade colonic enema (MACE)/Antegrade 
continence enema (ACE) stoma should be discussed.",3,Strong
"Ileal or colonic bladder augmentation is recommended in patients with therapy 
resistant overactivity of the detrusor, small capacity and poor compliance, which 
may cause upper tract damage and incontinence. The risk of surgical and non-
surgical complications and consequences outweigh the risk of permanent damage 
of the upper urinary tract +/- incontinence due to the detrusor.",2,Strong
"In patients with a neurogenic bladder and a weak sphincter, a bladder outlet 
procedure should be offered. It should be done in most patients together with a 
bladder augmentation.",3,Weak
"Creation of a continent cutaneous catheterisable channel should be offered to 
patients who have difficulties in performing an IC through the urethra.",3,Weak
"A life-long follow-up of renal and reservoir function should be available and offered 
to every patient. Addressing sexuality and fertility starting before/during puberty 
should be offered.",3,Weak
"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in children with neurogenic bladders, 
however, only symptomatic UTIs should be treated.",3,Weak
