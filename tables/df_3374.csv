Prognostic group IGCCCG,Treatment,LE
Good (SGCT and NSGCT),BEP x 3 or EP x 4,1b
Intermediate (SGCT and NSGCT),BEP x 4 or VIP x 4,1b
Poor (NSGCT),BEP x 4 or VIP x 4 if favourable marker decline,1b
,"Dose escalation in selected cases with inadequate serum 
tumour marker decline",1b
Summary of evidence,LE,
"Thromboembolic events occur more frequently in male patients with GCTs receiving chemotherapy 
than in young males under chemotherapy for other cancers.",2b,
"Retrospective studies have identified multiple risk factors for the development of thromboembolic 
events including increasing stage, size of retroperitoneal lymph nodes at different cut-offs, Khorana 
score > 3 and indwelling vascular access device (only modifiable risk factor).",2b,
Recommendations,Strength rating,
"Balance the individual patients’ potential benefits and risks of thromboprophylaxis during 
first-line chemotherapy in men with metastatic germ cell tumours.",Weak,
"Avoid use of central venous-access devices during first-line chemotherapy whenever 
possible.",Weak,
