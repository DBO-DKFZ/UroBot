Urodynamics
The role of urodynamics in SUI evaluation remains poorly defined and is still under debate.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Pelvic floor muscle training is better than no treatment for improving SUI and QoL in women with SUI 
and MUI across a range of outcomes, including cure rate, improvement rate, QoL, number and volume 
of urine leaks and treatment satisfaction.",1a
Pelvic floor muscle training exhibits a low rate of adverse events.,1a
"Higher-intensity, supervised treatment regimens confer greater benefit in women receiving PFMT.",1a
There is no extra benefit of combining PFMT with biofeedback.,1b
Short-term benefits of intensive PFMT can be maintained in the long term.,2a
"Pelvic floor muscle training in the antenatal period is associated with a reduced risk of UI in late 
pregnancy and in the short term postnatally.",1a
Postpartum PFMT is effective in women with persistent UI.,1b
"The benefit of postpartum PFMT in mixed populations (continent and incontinent) of women is 
uncertain.",1b
Mid-urethral sling surgery is superior to PFMT in women with moderate-to-severe SUI.,1b
"Pelvic floor muscle training commencing in the early postpartum period improves UI in women for up 
to six months.",1b
There is conflicting evidence on whether the addition of ES increases the effectiveness of PFMT alone.,2a
"There is low to moderate certainty evidence suggesting benefit of ES in patients with SUI. In addition, 
ES may be useful for learning a correct PFM contraction.",1b
