3.4.2.5.1	 Catheterisation
Intermittent self- or third-party catheterisation [225, 226] is the preferred management for neuro-urological 
patients who cannot effectively empty their bladders [130]. An adequate hand function is an independent risk 
factor for cessation of intermittent catheterisation (IC) [227]. 
Sterile IC, as originally proposed by Guttmann and Frankel [225], significantly reduces the risk of 
UTI and bacteriuria [130, 228, 229], compared with clean IC introduced by Lapides, et al., [226]. However, it 
has not yet been established whether or not the incidence of UTI, other complications and user satisfaction are 
affected by either sterile or clean IC, coated or uncoated catheters or by any other catheter type [230].",
