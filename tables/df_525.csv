Summary of evidence and guidelines for trimodality bladder-preserving treatment,
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer surgical intervention or trimodality bladder-preserving treatments (TMT) to appropriate 
candidates as primary curative therapeutic approaches since they are more effective than 
radiotherapy alone.",Strong
"Offer TMT as an alternative to selected, well-informed and compliant patients, especially for 
whom radical cystectomy is not an option or not acceptable.",Strong
Consensus statement,
"Candidates for curative treatment, such as cystectomy or bladder preservation, should be clinically assessed 
by at least an oncologist, a urologist, a radiation oncologist (in case adjuvant radiotherapy or bladder 
preservation is considered) and a neutral HCP such as a specialist nurse.",
"An important determinant for patient eligibility in case of bladder-preserving treatment is absence of 
carcinoma in situ.",
"An important determinant for patient eligibility in case of bladder-preserving treatment is absence or presence 
of hydronephrosis.",
"When assessing patient eligibility for bladder preservation, the likelihood of successful debulking surgery 
should be taken into consideration (optimal debulking).",
"In case of bladder preservation with radiotherapy, combination with a radiosensitiser is always recommended 
to improve clinical outcomes, such as cisplatin, 5-FU/MMC, carbogen/nicotinamide or gemcitabine.",
Radiotherapy for bladder preservation should be performed with IMRT and IGRT to reduce side effects.,
"Dose escalation above standard radical doses to the primary site in case of bladder preservation, either by 
IMRT or by brachytherapy, is not recommended.",
