4.1.4.3.4.4 Summary of evidence and recommendations for cystoplasty/urinary diversion,
Summary of evidence,LE
"There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of augmentation cystoplasty and urinary diversion 
specifically for treatment of idiopathic OAB or UUI.",3
"Augmentation cystoplasty and urinary diversion are associated with high risks of short- and long-term 
severe complications.",3
The need to perform CISC following augmentation cystoplasty is common.,3
"There is no evidence comparing the efficacy or adverse effects of augmentation cystoplasty to urinary 
diversion.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Ensure patient counselling and life-long support both prior to and after major surgery as a 
treatment for overactive bladder (OAB) is provided by a specialist nurse or equivalent health 
care provider.",Strong
"Offer augmentation cystoplasty to patients with OAB/urge urinary incontinence (UUI) 
who have failed all other treatment options and have been informed about all possible 
complications.",Weak
"Inform patients undergoing augmentation cystoplasty of the high risk of clean intermittent 
self-catheterisation (ensure they are willing and able to do so) and that they will need life-
long surveillance.",Strong
Do not offer detrusor myectomy as a treatment for UUI.,Weak
"Only offer urinary diversion to patients who have failed less-invasive therapies for the 
treatment of OAB/UUI, who will accept a stoma and have been warned about the possible 
small risk of malignancy.",Weak
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer early follow-up to women who have been commenced on anticholinergic or beta-3 
agonist therapy.",Strong
"Offer repeat injections of onabotulinumtoxinA, as required, to women in whom it has been 
effective (refer to the manufacturer’s guidance regarding the minimum timeframe for repeat 
injections).",Strong
"Offer life-long surveillance to women who have a sacral nerve stimulation implant to monitor 
for lead displacement, malfunction, and battery wear.",Strong
"Offer cystoscopic surveillance to women with an augmentation cystoplasty due to the small 
risk of malignancy.",Weak
