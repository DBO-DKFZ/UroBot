Table 3.1: Germline mutations in DNA repair genes associated with increased risk of prostate cancer,,,
Gene,Location,Prostate cancer risk,Findings
BRCA2,13q12.3,"- RR 2.5 to 4.6 [39, 40]
-  PCa at 55 years or 
under: RR: 8–23  
[39, 41]","•  up to 12 % of men with metastatic PCa harbour 
germline mutations in 16 genes (including BRCA2 
[5.3%]) [31]
•  2% of men with early-onset PCa harbour germline 
mutations in the BRCA2 gene [39]
•  BRCA2 germline alteration is an independent predictor 
of metastases and worse PCa-specific survival [35, 42]"
ATM,11q22.3,"RR: 6.3 for metastatic
PCa [31]","•  higher rates of lethal PCa among mutation carriers [37]
•  up to 12% of men with metastatic PCa harbour germline 
mutations in 16 genes (including ATM [1.6%]) [31]"
CHEK2,22q12.1,"OR 3.3 [43, 44]","•  up to 12% of men with metastatic PCa harbour germline 
mutations in 16 genes (including CHEK2 [1.9%]) [31]"
BRCA1,17q21,"RR: 1.8–3.8 at 65 years 
or under [45, 46]","•  higher rates of lethal PCa among mutation carriers [37]
•  up to 12% of men with metastatic PCa harbour germline 
mutations in 16 genes (including BRCA1 [0.9%]) [31]"
HOXB13,17q21.2,"OR 3.4–7.9 [32, 47]","•  significantly higher PSA at diagnosis, higher Gleason 
score and higher incidence of positive surgical margins 
in the radical prostatectomy specimen than non-carriers 
[48]"

7p22.2",RR: 3.7 [49],"•  Mutations in MMR genes are responsible for Lynch 
syndrome [50]
•  MSH2 mutation carriers are more likely to develop PCa 
than other MMR gene mutation carriers [51]"
