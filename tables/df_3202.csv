"10.2.1.4.8	 Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors
Low doses of PDE5Is have a paradoxical effect in alleviating and preventing stuttering priapism; mainly in 
patients with idiopathic and SCD-associated priapism [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694-1698] (LE: 3). It is important to 
remember that therapy should be started when the penis is in its flaccid state and not during an acute episode. 
There is a delay of one week before treatment is effective. There are no reported impairments in male sexual 
function (LE: 3). Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor treatment of stuttering priapism is possibly mediated by 
an increase in the concentration of cGMP in the smooth muscle in an NO dysfunctional state. This can occur 
in priapism and may result in a change in the NO pathway, with down-regulation of cavernosal PDE5 thereby 
preventing the complete degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"The primary goal in the management of patients with stuttering priapism is prevention of future 
episodes, which can generally be achieved pharmacologically.",2b
"Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors have a paradoxical effect in alleviating and preventing stuttering 
priapism, mainly in patients with idiopathic and SCD-associated priapism.",3
"The evidence with other systemic drugs (digoxin, α-adrenergic agonists, baclofen, gabapentin and 
terbutaline, hydroxyurea) is limited.",3
