Robot-assisted kidney transplant surgery
Robot-assisted kidney transplant (RAKT) surgery using living donor kidneys has been evaluated in multi-centre 
prospective non-randomised studies (using IDEAL consortium principles) [126]. Single-centre prospective non-
randomised studies are on-going addressing RAKT with use of deceased donor kidneys. Both trans- and 
extra-peritoneal approaches for RAKT are described. Potential advantages of RAKT may exist (decreased post-
operative pain, incision length and lymphocele rate). Potential issues with RAKT are the exclusion of recipients 
with severe atherosclerosis or third (or further) kidney transplants, a higher than expected rate of DGF and a 
small number of reported early arterial thromboses despite carefully selected cases [127]. The learning curve for 
RAKT has been reported to be 35 cases for experienced surgeons in a retrospective multicentre series of 187 
patients undergoing RAKT [128]. Complication and DGF rates decreased significantly and plateaued after the first 
 
20 cases. The rate of Clavien-Dindo grade III/IV complications was 14% during the first ten RAKTs, but only 3% 
after this [128]. The rate of arterial graft thrombosis (1.6%) was comparable with that for open kidney transplant 
(0.5 - 3.5%) [128]. A ten year single-centre retrospective analysis of 239 obese RAKT patients concluded that 
RAKT can be safely performed in obese patients with minimal risk of developing a surgical site infection [129]. A 
graft failure rate of 7.1% was reported during follow-up mostly due to acute rejection. Patient and graft survival 
was 95% and 93% at three years, respectively [129]. Evidence is too premature to recommend RAKT outside of 
appropriately mentored prospective studies.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"A meta-analysis of two RCTs and 24 observational studies favoured the extra-vesical Lich-Gregoir 
technique for reduced overall complications.",1a
"A multi-centre prospective comparison study found the incidence of overall complications was similar 
for pyelo- and uretero-ureteral anastomosis and that for both procedures no graft was lost due to 
urological complications.",2b
