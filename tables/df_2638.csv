Methods of kidney preservation: static and dynamic preservation
Whichever method is used, cold storage is critical. The use of cold preservation as a therapeutic window 
to deliver pharmacological or gene therapy treatments could, from an investigational point of view, improve 
both short- and long-term graft outcomes [43]. Cooling reduces the metabolic rate of biological tissue 
minimising continuous cellular processes that lead to depletion of ATP and accumulation of metabolic 
products. Reperfusion with oxygenated blood invokes ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Hypothermic perfusion 
does not enable normal cellular metabolic function or prevent depletion of energy stores [44]; however, it 
prevents the deleterious effects of simple cooling, especially in the setting of prolonged warm-ischaemic time 
in uncontrolled DCD donors. Two meta-analyses suggest that hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) reduces 
DGF compared with static cold storage [45, 46]. Outcomes for primary non-function (PNF) are less clear, but 
one meta-analysis limited to high quality studies suggests a reduction in PNF rates with HMP [46]. A Cochrane 
systematic review and meta-analysis showed that HMP reduced the risk of DGF when compared to static cold 
storage (CS) for kidneys from both DCD and DBD donors [47].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"A meta-analysis of RCTs comparing CS with HMP of deceased donor kidneys showed a reduced risk 
of DGF for HMP.",1a
"Hypothermic dynamic preservation should be controlled by pressure and not flow, using low pressures 
to avoid pressure-related injury.",2a
"Perfusion parameters (renal flow and renal vascular resistance) have low predictive values and should 
not be used as the sole criterion to assess viability of kidney grafts.",2b
