The depth of invasion (staging) is classified according to the TNM classification.,2a
"Tumours confined to the mucosa and invading the lamina propria are classified as stage Ta and T1, 
respectively. Flat, high-grade tumours that are confined to the mucosa are classified as CIS (Tis).",2a
"Histological grading of urothelial NMIBC is classified according to the WHO 1973 (G1–G3) and/or the 
WHO 2004/2016 (PUNLMP, LG/HG) systems.",2a
"Both the WHO 1973 and the 2004/2016 classification systems are prognostic for progression, but not 
for recurrence.",2a
"The WHO 1973 is a stronger prognosticator of progression in TaT1 NMIBC than the WHO 2004/2022. 
However, a 3-tier hybrid (LG/G1-G2, HG/G2 & HG/G3) or a 4-tier hybrid LG/G1, LG/G2, HG/G2 and HG/
G3) combination of both classification systems proved to be superior to either classification system alone.",2a
The WHO 2004/2022 classification provides better reproducibility than the 1973 classification.,2a
PUNLMP lesions have the same prognosis as Ta LG carcinomas.,2a
