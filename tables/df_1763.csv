Circumcision
Circumcision requires anaesthesia and proper pain management [1505]. Potential analgesic interventions 
during circumcision include the use of a dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) or ring block, topical anaesthetics 
(e.g. lidocaine-prilocaine cream, or 4% liposomal lidocaine cream), and sucrose preferably in combination 
[1498, 1504]. Caudal blockade methods have similar efficacy compared to DPNB. However, caregivers should 
be informed about the more frequent incidence of post-operative motor weakness and micturition problems 
[1506]. Ultrasound guidance can be used [1504].",
