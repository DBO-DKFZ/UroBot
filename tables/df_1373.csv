"5.6.5.2.3	 Autologous slings
The strategy of intra-operative placement of an autologous vas deferens sling below the vesico-urethral 
anastomosis during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has been explored with the intention to 
improve early return of continence. Two RCTs [653, 654] showed an advantage of sling vs. no sling at one-
month follow-up, and another study [655] showed an advantage of a 6-branch vs. a 2-branch sling at one 
month follow-up. However, a larger RCT (n=195), showed that continence rate and near-continence rate were 
similar between groups at six months with 66% vs. 65% and 86% vs. 88%, respectively [656].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Primary AUS implantation is effective for cure of SUI in men.,1b
"There are conflicting data on whether previous pelvic radiotherapy affects the outcome of AUS 
implantation.",3
"The non-circumferential compression device (ProACT®) is effective for treatment of PPI SUI; however, 
it is associated with a high failure and complication rate leading to frequent explantation and 
particularly after pelvic radiation therapy.",2b
The rate of explantation of the AUS due to infection or erosion remains high (up to 24% in some series).,3
