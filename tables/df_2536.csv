Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,,,,
"Functional follow-up after curative treatment for RCC is useful to prevent renal and cardiovascular 
deterioration.",4,,,,,,,,
"Oncological follow-up can detect local recurrence or metastatic disease while the patient may still be 
surgically curable.",4,,,,,,,,
"After NSS, there is an increased risk of recurrence for larger (> 7 cm) tumours, or when there is a PSM.",3,,,,,,,,
Patients undergoing follow-up have a better OS than patients not undergoing follow-up.,3,,,,,,,,
"Prognostic models provide stratification of RCC risk of recurrence based on TNM and histological 
features.",3,,,,,,,,
"In competing-risk models, risk of non-RCC-related death exceeds that of RCC recurrence or related 
death in low-risk patients.",3,,,,,,,,
Life expectancy estimation is feasible and may support counselling of patients on duration of follow-up.,4,,,,,,,,

surgical margin.",Weak,,,,,,,,

RCC recurrence risk.",Weak,,,,,,,,
