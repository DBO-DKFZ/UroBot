Summary of evidence and guidelines for follow-up during active surveillance,
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Base follow-up during active surveillance (AS) on a strict protocol including digital rectal 
examination (at least once yearly), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (at least once every  
6 months) and repeated biopsy every 2 to 3 years.",Strong
"Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and repeat biopsy if PSA is rising (PSA-doubling 
time < 3 years).",Strong
"Re-classify patients with low-volume ISUP grade group 2 disease included in AS protocols, 
if repeat non-MRI-based systematic biopsies performed during monitoring reveal > 3 
positive cores or maximum CI > 50%/core of ISUP 2 disease.",Weak
"Base change in treatment on biopsy progression, not on progression on MRI and/or PSA.",Weak
"Patients with a PI-RADS 1-2 findings on MRI and a low PSA density (< 0.15) may be 
excepted from repeat biopsy.",Weak
"Recommendations 
Strength rating",
Watchful Waiting,
"Manage patients with a life expectancy < 10 years by watchful waiting. 
Strong",
Active surveillance (AS),
"Manage patients with a life expectancy > 10 years and low-risk disease by AS.
Strong",
Selection of patients,
Patients with intraductal histology on biopsy should be excluded from AS.,Strong
"Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before a confirmatory biopsy if no MRI has been 
performed before the initial biopsy.",Strong
"Take both targeted biopsy (of any PI-RADS > 3 lesion) and systematic biopsy if a 
confirmatory biopsy is performed.",Strong
"If MRI is not available, per-protocol confirmatory prostate biopsies should be performed.",Weak
"If a patient has had upfront MRI followed by systematic and targeted biopsies there is no 
need for confirmatory biopsies.",Weak
Follow-up of patients,
"Repeat biopsies should be performed at least once every 3 years for 10 years. 
Weak",
"In case of prostate-specific antigen progression or change in digital-rectal examination or 
Strong
MRI findings, do not progress to active treatment without a repeat biopsy.",
