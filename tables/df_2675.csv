Treatment of antibody mediated rejection (ABMR)
Treatment of ABMR relies mainly on retrospective studies and empirical treatment guidelines [367]. Consensus 
is that it is important to classify the clinical and histological phenotype of the rejection in order to make 
adequate treatment decisions [367]. Important clinical factors are time of rejection (early acute < 30 days 
 
post-transplant vs. late), preformed vs. de novo donor-specific antibodies (DSA), and histology (active vs. 
chronic rejection).",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Use steroid bolus therapy as first-line treatment for T-cell mediated rejection in addition to 
ensuring adequate baseline immunosuppression.",Strong
"In severe or steroid-resistant rejection, use intensified immunosuppression, high-dose 
steroid treatment, and eventually T-cell depleting agents.",Strong
