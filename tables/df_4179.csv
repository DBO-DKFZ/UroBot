Table 7: Suggested regimens for antimicrobial therapy for urosepsis.,,
Summary of evidence,LE,
"Initial high dose empiric antimicrobial therapy, administered within the first hour, should provide broad 
antimicrobial coverage against all likely causative pathogens and should be adapted on the basis of 
culture results, once available.",2b,
"Source control interventions should be implemented as soon as possible to control or eliminate 
diagnosed and/or suspected infectious foci.",3,
Recommendations,Strength rating,
Perform the quickSOFA score to identify patients with potential sepsis.,Strong,
Take a urine culture and two sets of blood cultures before starting antimicrobial treatment.,Strong,
"Administer parenteral high dose broad spectrum antimicrobials within the first hour after 
clinical assumption of sepsis.",Strong,
Adapt initial empiric antimicrobial therapy on the basis of culture results.,Strong,
"Initiate source control including removal of foreign bodies, decompression of obstruction 
and drainage of abscesses in the urinary tract.",Strong,
Provide immediate adequate life-support measures.,Strong,
