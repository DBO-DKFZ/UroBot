Summary of evidence,LE,,
Sexual symptoms are the most specific symptoms associated with LOH.,1a,,
"Diagnosis of LOH should be based on specific signs and symptoms of androgen deficiency, together 
with consistently low serum testosterone levels.",1a,,
12 nmol/L total testosterone (3.5 ng/mL) represents a reliable threshold to diagnose LOH.,1a,,
"Functional hypogonadism is a consequence of comorbidity/concomitant drugs, which can impair 
testosterone production in adulthood. The diagnosis of functional hypogonadism is a diagnosis of 
exclusion, after ruling out organic causes of hypogonadism.",4,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,
"Check for concomitant diseases, drugs and substances that can interfere with testosterone 
production/action.",Strong,,
"Measure total testosterone in the morning (07.00 and 11.00 hours) and in the fasting state, 
with a reliable laboratory assay.",Strong,,
"Repeat total testosterone on at least two separate occasions when < 12 nmol/L and before 
starting testosterone therapy.",Strong,,
"Use 12 nmol/L total testosterone (3.5 ng/mL) as a reliable threshold to diagnose late onset 
hypogonadism (LOH).",Strong,,
Consider sex hormone-binding globulin and free-testosterone calculation when indicated.,Strong,,
"Calculated free-testosterone of < 225 pmol/L has been suggested as a possible cut-off to 
diagnose LOH.",Weak,,
"Analyse luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone serum levels to differentiate 
between primary and secondary hypogonadism.",Strong,,
"Consider prolactin (PRL) measurement if low sexual desire (or other suggestive signs/
symptoms) and low or low-normal testosterone is present.",Strong,,
"Perform pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in secondary hypogonadism, with 
elevated PRL or symptoms specific of a pituitary mass and/or presence of other anterior 
pituitary hormone deficiency.",Strong,,
Perform pituitary MRI in secondary severe hypogonadism (total testosterone < 6 nmol/L).,Weak,,
