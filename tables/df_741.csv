Table 7.2: Categories of high-grade recurrence during or after BCG
Whenever a MIBC is detected during follow-up.
BCG-refractory tumour
"1. If T1 HG/G3 tumour is present at 3 months [236, 384, 387] (LE: 3).
2.  If Ta HG/G3 tumour is present after 3 months and/or at 6 months, after either re-induction or first course of 
maintenance [360] (LE: 4).
3.  If CIS (without concomitant papillary tumour) is present at 3 months and persists at 6 months after either 
re-induction or first course of maintenance. If patients with CIS present at 3 months, an additional BCG 
course can achieve a complete response in > 50% of cases [67, 356, 360] (LE: 1b).
4. If HG tumour appears during BCG maintenance therapy*."
BCG-relapsing tumour
"Recurrence of HG/G3) tumour after completion of BCG maintenance, despite an initial response [388] (LE: 3)."
BCG-unresponsive tumour
"BCG-unresponsive tumours include all BCG refractory tumours and those who develop T1/Ta HG recurrence 
within 6 months of completion of adequate BCG exposure** or develop CIS within 12 months of completion 
of adequate BCG exposure [385] (LE: 4)."
BCG intolerance
Severe side effects that prevent further BCG instillation before completing treatment [330].
