Surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile shortness
Current literature reports a wide spectrum of possible surgical interventions aimed to address penile 
shortness. Nonetheless, the proposed spectrum of surgical interventions starts from less invasive procedures 
- such as suspensory ligament release (SLR) - to more complex genital reconstruction - such as total phallic 
reconstruction (TPR) [1493, 1494]. These issues make the surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile 
shortness a surgical challenge in urology.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Considering the wide spectrum and the complexity of surgical interventions aimed to address penile 
shortness, this surgery should be reserved to high volume centres.",4
"Suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy 
provide an objective increase in penile length.",3
"Suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy are 
associated with a significant incidence of complications.",3
"Total phallic reconstruction provides satisfactory surgical and functional outcomes in men with 
micropenis.",3
