Prospective randomised trials on intravesical BCG or chemotherapy
Unfortunately, there have been few RCTs in patients with CIS only. A meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing 
intravesical BCG to intravesical chemotherapy in patients with CIS has shown a significantly increased 
response rate after BCG and a reduction of 59% in the odds of treatment failure with BCG [357] (LE: 1a). 
In an EORTC-GUCG meta-analysis of tumour progression, in a subgroup of 403 patients with CIS, 
BCG reduced the risk of progression by 35% as compared to intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy 
[281] (LE: 1b). The combination of BCG and MMC was not superior to BCG alone [358]. In summary, compared 
to chemotherapy, BCG treatment of CIS increases the complete response rate, the overall percentage of 
patients who remain disease free, and reduces the risk of tumour progression (LE: 1b).",
