Summary of evidence,LE
"Prompted voiding, either alone or as part of a behavioural modification programme, improves 
continence in elderly, care-dependent, people in the short-term.",1b
"Bladder training is effective for improvement of UUI in women, but efficacy appears to be lower than 
that of pharmacotherapy.",1b
Pelvic floor muscle training may improve symptoms of frequency of OAB in women.,1b
"Electrical stimulation may improve symptoms of OAB in some women, but the type and mode of 
delivery of ES remains variable and poorly standardised.",1a
"Posterior tibial nerve stimulation is more effective than antimuscarinics in reducing UUI episodes but 
with no difference in improving other OAB symptoms.",1a
A maintenance programme of P-PTNS has been shown to be effective for up to 3 years.,2a
"Transcutaneous-PTNS appears to be effective in reducing OAB symptom compared to sham 
treatment.",1a
"Transcutaneous -PTNS is not inferior to percutaneous -PTNS with regard to improvement in urinary 
urgency, frequency, and QoL scores.",1a
