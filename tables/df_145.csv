Summary of evidence and guidelines for neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Results support the activity of NAC in patients with clinically involved regional LNs from penile SCC. 
However, randomised studies are lacking, and substantial concerns remain regarding the selection of 
patients who are best suited for a systemic therapy approach upfront.",2b
"The available evidence favours a cisplatin- and taxane-based combination (doublet or triplet) as the 
preferred approach.",2b
"Limited data support the use of adjuvant chemotherapy to improve OS following surgical resection. 
However, it could be offered to patients with pN3 disease post-LND if NAC has not been received, 
upon careful consideration of risks and benefits with the patient.",4
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy using a cisplatin- and taxane-based combination to 
chemotherapy-fit patients with pelvic lymph node involvement or those with extensive 
inguinal involvement (cN3), in preference to up front surgery.",Weak
"Offer chemotherapy as an alternative approach to upfront surgery to selected patients with 
bulky mobile inguinal nodes or bilateral disease (cN2) who are candidates for cisplatin and 
taxane-based chemotherapy.",Weak
"Have a balanced discussion of risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy with high-risk 
patients with surgically resected disease, in particular with those with pathological pelvic LN 
involvement (pN3). See also section on post-operative radiotherapy.",Weak
