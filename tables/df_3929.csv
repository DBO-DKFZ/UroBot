Stone composition
Stones composed of brushite, calcium oxalate monohydrate, or cystine are particularly hard, as well as 
homogeneous stones with a high density on NCCT [46, 352]. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy or RIRS and URS 
are alternatives for removal of large SWL-resistant stones.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer active surveillance to patients at high risk of thrombotic complications in the presence 
of an asymptomatic calyceal stone.",Weak
"Decide on temporary discontinuation, or bridging of antithrombotic therapy in high-risk 
patients, in consultation with the internist.",Strong
"Retrograde (flexible) ureteroscopy is the preferred intervention if stone removal is essential 
and antithrombotic therapy cannot be discontinued since it is associated with less morbidity.",Strong
