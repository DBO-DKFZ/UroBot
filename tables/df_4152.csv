Introduction
Urethritis can be of either infectious or non-infectious origin. Inflammation of the urethra presents usually with 
LUTS and must be distinguished from other infections of the lower urinary tract. Urethral infection is typically 
spread by sexual contact.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Initial high dose empiric antimicrobial therapy, administered within the first hour, should provide broad 
antimicrobial coverage against all likely causative pathogens and should be adapted on the basis of 
culture results, once available.",2b
"Source control interventions should be implemented as soon as possible to control or eliminate 
diagnosed and/or suspected infectious foci.",3
