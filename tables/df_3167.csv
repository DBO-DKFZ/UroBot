Male breast cancer
In vitro and in vivo studies have clearly documented that breast cancer growth is significantly influenced by 
testosterone and/or by its conversion to E2 through different mechanisms and pathways [143]. Accordingly, 
the use of SERMs still represents an important therapeutic option in the management of this cancer [143]. 
No information is available on the role of testosterone therapy in patients successfully treated for male breast 
cancer; therefore, treated and active male breast cancer should be recognised as absolute contraindications 
for testosterone therapy.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Fully counsel symptomatic hypogonadal men who have been surgically treated for localised 
prostate cancer (PCa) and who are currently without evidence of active disease considering 
testosterone therapy, emphasising the benefits and lack of sufficient safety data on long-
term follow-up.",Weak
"Restrict treatment to patients with a low risk for recurrent PCa (i.e., pre-operative PSA  
< 10 ng/mL; Gleason score < 7 [International Society for Urological Pathology grade 1];  
cT1-2a)* and treatment should start after at least one year follow-up with PSA level  
< 0.01 ng/mL.",Weak
"Advise patients that safety data on the use of testosterone therapy in men treated for breast 
cancer are unknown.",Strong
Assess cardiovascular risk factors before commencing testosterone therapy.,Strong
"Assess men with known cardiovascular disease (CVD) for cardiovascular symptoms before 
testosterone therapy and with close clinical assessment and evaluation during treatment.",Strong
"Treat men with hypogonadism and pre-existing CVD, venous-thromboembolism or chronic 
cardiac failure, who require testosterone therapy with caution, by careful clinical monitoring 
and regular measurement of haematocrit (not exceeding 54%) and testosterone levels.",Weak
Exclude a family history of venous-thromboembolism before starting testosterone therapy.,Strong
"Monitor testosterone, haematocrit at three, six and twelve months after testosterone therapy 
initiation, and thereafter annually. A haematocrit > 54% should require testosterone therapy 
withdrawal and phlebotomy. Re-introduce testosterone therapy at a lower dose once the 
haematocrit has normalised and consider switching to topical testosterone preparations.",Strong
"Evaluate patients with polycythaemia vera and those with a higher risk of developing 
elevated haematocrit every three months during the first year of testosterone therapy, and at 
least every six months thereafter.",Strong
"Evaluate total PSA in PCa survivors at three, six and twelve months during the first year of 
testosterone therapy, and annually thereafter.",Strong
