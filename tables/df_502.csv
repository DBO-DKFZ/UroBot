Bleeding and pain
In the case of bleeding, the patient must be screened first for coagulation disorders or the patient’s use of 
anticoagulant drugs must be reviewed. Transurethral (laser) coagulation may be difficult in a bladder full of 
tumour or with a bleeding tumour. Intravesical rinsing of the bladder with 1% silver nitrate or 1–2% alum can 
be effective [403]. This can usually be done without any anaesthesia. The instillation of formalin (2.5–4% for 30 
minutes) is a more aggressive and painful procedure, requiring anaesthesia. Formalin instillation has a higher 
risk of side-effects, e.g., bladder fibrosis, but is more likely to control the bleeding [403]. Vesicoureteral reflux 
should be excluded to prevent renal complications.",
