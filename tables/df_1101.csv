"4.7.4.1.1	 Pelvic floor muscle training versus lifestyle advice
An RCT (n = 109) reported that, at six months’ follow-up, the ICIQ-UI-SF scores improved in favour of the 
PFMT group (2.40 points) compared with a control group receiving lifestyle advice only (0.2 points), but the 
mean baseline score in the PFMT group was higher than in the control group (7.4 vs. 5.9) [638]. Likewise, it 
has to be noted that the absolute ICIQ-UI-SF values at six months’ follow-up were not significantly different 
between PFMT (4.8) and controls (5.2).",
