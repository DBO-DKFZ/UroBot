Immune checkpoint inhibitors
7.4.3.1.1	 Immuno-oncology monotherapy
Immune checkpoint inhibitor with monoclonal antibodies targets and blocks the inhibitory T-cell receptor PD-1 
or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-signalling to restore tumour-specific T-cell immunity 
[512]. Immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy has been investigated as second- and third-line therapy. A 
phase III trial of nivolumab vs. everolimus after one or two lines of VEGF-targeted therapy for mRCC with a 
clear cell component (CheckMate 025, NCT01668784) reported a longer OS, better QoL and fewer grade 3 or 
4 AEs with nivolumab than with everolimus [513]. Nivolumab has superior OS to everolimus (HR: 0.73, 95% 
CI: 0.57–0.93, p < 0.002) in VEGF-refractory RCC with a median OS of 25 months for nivolumab and 19.6 
months for everolimus with a 5-year OS probability of 26% vs. 18% [514] (LE: 1b). Patients who had failed 
multiple lines of VEGF-targeted therapy were included in this trial making the results broadly applicable. The 
trial included 15% MSKCC poor-risk patients. There was no PFS advantage with nivolumab despite the OS 
advantage. Progression-free survival does not appear to be a reliable surrogate of outcome for PD-1 therapy in 
RCC. Currently PD-L1 biomarkers are not used to select patients for this therapy.",

"Currently, PD-L1 expression is not used for patient selection.",2b
"The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in treatment-naïve patients with cc-mRCC of IMDC 
intermediate- and poor risk demonstrated OS and ORR benefits compared to sunitinib alone.",1b
"The combination of pembrolizumab plus axitinib, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and nivolumab plus 
cabozantinib in treatment-naïve patients with cc-mRCC across all IMDC risk groups demonstrated 
PFS, OS and ORR benefits compared to sunitinib.",1b
"Nivolumab plus ipilimumab, pembrolizumab plus axitinib, nivolumab plus cabozantinib and lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab should be administered in centres with experience of immune combination 
therapy and appropriate supportive care within the context of a multidisciplinary team.",4
"The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk population of 
treatment-naïve patients with cc-mRCC leads to superior survival compared to sunitinib.",2b
Sequencing systemic therapy,
"Nivolumab leads to superior OS compared to everolimus in disease progression after one or two lines 
of VEGF-targeted therapy.",1b
"Axitinib, cabozantinib or lenvatinib can be continued if immune-related AEs result in cessation 
of axitinib plus pembrolizumab, cabozantinib plus nivolumab or lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab. 
Re-challenge with immunotherapy requires expert support.",4
