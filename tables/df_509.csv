Follow-up in muscle invasive bladder cancer
An appropriate schedule for disease monitoring should be based on natural timing of recurrence; probability 
and site of recurrence; functional monitoring after urinary diversion and the potential available management 
options [542].
Nomograms on CSS following RC have been developed and externally validated, but their wider 
use cannot be recommended until further data become available [543, 544].
Current surveillance protocols are based on patterns of recurrence drawn from retrospective series 
only. Combining this data is not possible since most retrospective studies use different follow-up regimens and 
imaging techniques. Additionally, reports of asymptomatic recurrences diagnosed during routine oncological 
follow-up and results from retrospective studies are contradictory [545-547]. From the Volkmer B, et al., 
series of 1,270 RC patients, no differences in OS were observed between asymptomatic and symptomatic 
recurrences [546]. Conversely, in the Giannarini, et al., series of 479 patients; those with recurrences detected 
during routine follow-up (especially in the lungs) and with secondary urothelial tumours as the site of 
recurrence, had a slightly higher survival [545]. Boorjian, et al., included 1,599 RC patients in their series, with 
77% symptomatic recurrences. On multivariate analysis, patients who were symptomatic at recurrence had a 
60% increased risk of death as compared to asymptomatic patients [547].
However, at this time, no data from prospective trials demonstrating the potential benefit of early 
detection of recurrent disease and its impact on OS are available [548].",

comorbidities, tumour variables and coping abilities.",Strong
