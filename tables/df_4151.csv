3.8.3.1	
Clinical diagnosis
Signs and systemic symptoms compatible with CA-UTI include new onset or worsening of fever, rigors, altered 
mental status, malaise, or lethargy with no other identified cause, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, 
acute haematuria, pelvic discomfort and in those whose catheters have been removed dysuria, urgent or 
frequent urination and suprapubic pain or tenderness [217]. In the catheterised patient, the presence or 
absence of odorous or cloudy urine alone should not be used to differentiate CA-ABU from CA-UTI [217, 218].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"A systematic review of nineteen different interventions to reduce UTI including catheter discontinuation 
and limiting catheterisation in nursing home patients reported successful CA-UTI reduction and 
reduced catheter usage.",1b
"A meta-analysis of seven studies investigating RCTs comparing hydrophilic coated to PVC (standard) 
catheters for IC found a statistically lower risk ratio (0.84) for the frequency of UTI in the hydrophilic 
catheter group.",1a
"A meta-analysis showed overall benefit for use of prophylaxis for reduction of infective complications 
after catheter removal; however, results from individual trials were inconsistent with five out of seven 
trials including the possibility of no benefit.",1a
"A subsequent RCT found no benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis for reduction of infective complications at 
up to four weeks after catheter removal.",1b
