Table 7.1:  Management options for side effects associated with intravesical BCG [330-333],
Management options for local side effects (modified from International Bladder Cancer Group),
Symptoms of cystitis,"Phenazopyridine, propantheline bromide, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs)."
,If symptoms improve within a few days: continue instillations.
,"If symptoms persist or worsen:
a.  Postpone the instillation
b.  Perform a urine culture
c.  Start empirical antibiotic treatment"
,"If symptoms persist even with antibiotic treatment:
a.  With positive culture: adjust antibiotic treatment according to sensitivity
b. 
With negative culture: quinolones and potentially analgesic anti-inflammatory 
instillations once daily for 5 days (repeat cycle if necessary) [331]."
,If symptoms persist: anti-tuberculosis drugs + corticosteroids.
,If no response to treatment and/or contracted bladder: radical cystectomy.
Haematuria,Perform urine culture to exclude haemorrhagic cystitis if other symptoms present.
,"If haematuria persists, perform cystoscopy to evaluate presence of bladder tumour."
"Symptomatic 
granulomatous
prostatitis",Symptoms rarely present: perform urine culture.
,Quinolones.
,"If quinolones are not effective: isoniazid (300 mg/day) and rifampicin (600 mg/day) 
for 3 months."
,Cessation of intravesical therapy.
"Epididymo-orchitis 
[332]",Perform urine culture and administer quinolones.
,Cessation of intravesical therapy.
,Orchidectomy if abscess or no response to treatment.
Management options for systemic side effects,
"General malaise, fever","Generally resolve within 48 hours, with or without antipyretics."
"Arthralgia and/or 
arthritis",Rare complication and considered autoimmune reaction.
,Arthralgia: treatment with NSAIDs.
,Reactive arthritis: NSAIDs.
,"If no/partial response, proceed to corticosteroids, high-dose quinolones or 
antituberculosis drugs [333]."
"Persistent high-grade 
fever  
(> 38.5°C for > 48 h)",Permanent discontinuation of BCG instillations.
,"Immediate evaluation: urine culture, blood tests, chest X-ray."
,"Prompt treatment with more than two antimicrobial agents while diagnostic 
evaluation is conducted."
,Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist.
BCG sepsis,"Prevention: initiate BCG at least 2 weeks post-transurethral resection of the bladder 
(if no signs and symptoms of haematuria)."
,Cessation of BCG.
,"For severe infection:
• 
High-dose quinolones or isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol 1.2 g daily for  
6 months.
• 
Early, high-dose corticosteroids as long as symptoms persist.
• 
Consider an empirical non-specific antibiotic to cover Gram-negative bacteria 
and/or Enterococcus."
Allergic reactions,Antihistamines and anti-inflammatory agents.
,Consider high-dose quinolones or isoniazid and rifampicin for persistent symptoms.
,Delay therapy until reactions resolve.
