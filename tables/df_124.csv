Adjuvant chemotherapy 
There are known poor prognostic characteristics for a subset of patients with resected high-risk disease (such 
as involved pelvic LNs), indicating the likely presence of micrometastatic disease. Data exists on response 
rates for those with metastatic disease and there is possible benefit for pre-operative chemotherapy for those 
with unresectable locally advanced disease as described above. With extrapolation from other diseases, it 
stands to reason that systemic therapy following resection (i.e., adjuvant therapy) may improve outcomes.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Adjuvant radiotherapy results in increased OS if greater than two inguinal LN-positive and PLND-
dissection negative.",2b
"Adjuvant conventional radiotherapy doses are often insufficient for durable control. Increased DSS and 
RFS in penile cancer requires 54 Gy for ENE and 57–60 Gy for positive margins.",3
Peri-operative chemo-radiotherapy,
"1b 
chemo-radiotherapy significantly improves loco-regional control over radiotherapy alone for other SCC 
originating in anal canal or head and neck, whilst in vulvar cancers it improves OS. The evidence is, 
however, sparse in penile cancer.",
