Table 5.2: Risk of PCa identified by systemic PCa biopsy in relation to low PSA values [173],,
"Offer a risk-adapted strategy (based on initial PSA level), with follow-up intervals of 2 years 
for those initially at risk:
• 
men with a PSA level of > 1 ng/mL at 40 years of age;
• 
men with a PSA level of > 2 ng/mL at 60 years of age;
Postpone follow-up up to 8 years in those not at risk.",Weak,
"In asymptomatic men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level between 3–10 ng/mL and 
a normal digital rectal examination (DRE), repeat the PSA test prior to further investigations.",Weak,
"In asymptomatic men with a PSA level between 3–10 ng/mL and a normal DRE, use one of 
the following tools for biopsy indication:
• 
risk-calculator, provided it is correctly calibrated to the population prevalence;
• 
magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate;",Strong,
"• 
an additional serum, urine biomarker test.",Weak,
"Stop early diagnosis of PCa based on life expectancy and performance status; men who 
have a life-expectancy of < 15 years are unlikely to benefit.",Strong,
