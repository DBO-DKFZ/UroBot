Comparison of different types of flaps
Different local flaps have been described. Penile skin flaps are generally hairless, although the ventral penile 
skin can be hair-bearing around the raphe in some ethnic groups/phenotypes. They can be harvested as a 
transverse preputial skin flap [511], a transverse distal PSF [358, 508, 512, 513] or as a longitudinal island 
flap [514]. Urethral patency rates vary between 74.2-100% [274, 358, 508, 511-514]. Complications include 
skin necrosis (0-3.8%), fistula (0-7%), penile deformity (0-7%), post-void dribbling (0-79%) and sacculation 
(0-16.5%) (see supplementary Table S9.1). As there are no direct comparative series available about these flaps 
it is not possible to determine which performs better.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Flaps have a higher urogenital morbidity, but a comparable patency rate compared to grafts.",1b
"Grafts have a significantly higher complication rate compared to flaps when complete tubularisation in 
a single-stage approach is needed.",1b
Flaps do not rely on the local vascularisation of the recipient site.,3
