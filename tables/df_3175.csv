Diagnostic evaluation
Taking a medical and sexual history is usually sufficient to establish a diagnosis of CPC. Patients usually 
present after reaching puberty as the curvature becomes more apparent with erections, and more severe 
curvatures can make intercourse difficult or impossible. Physical examination and photographic documentation 
during erection (preferably after intracavernous injection [ICI] of vasoactive drugs) are both mandatory to 
document the curvature and exclude other pathologies [1020].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Medical and sexual history are usually sufficient to establish a diagnosis of CPC. Physical examination 
and photographic documentation during erection (preferably after intracavernous injection [ICI] of 
vasoactive drugs) are both mandatory to document the curvature",3
"There is no role for medical management of CPC. Surgery is the only treatment option, which can be 
deferred until after puberty and can be performed at any time in adult life in individuals with significant 
functional impairment during intercourse.",3
