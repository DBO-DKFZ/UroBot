Enucleation of the prostate
5.3.2.1	
Open prostatectomy
Mechanism of action: Open prostatectomy is the oldest surgical treatment for moderate-to-severe LUTS 
secondary to BPO. Obstructive adenomas are enucleated using the index finger, approaching from within 
the bladder (Freyer procedure) or through the anterior prostatic capsule (Millin procedure). It is used for 
substantially enlarged glands (> 80-100 mL).",
