"6.3.5.1.4	 Extirpative surgery and urinary diversion for non-traumatic posterior urethral stenosis
In complex and/or recurrent cases [408], LUT reconstruction is not possible or not indicated due to severe 
necrosis, calcification and significant morbidity, especially severe pain [407]. Intractable haematuria or 
fistulation might be other reasons to abandon the urethral outlet. Typically, the patient has a history of pelvic 
irradiation or high energy prostate cancer treatment and several previous attempts to achieve cure. Moreover, 
and equally important, any of the options used to deal with a devastated posterior urethra are dependent 
upon good bladder capacity, compliance and function allowing for bladder preservation as well as healthy 
distal ureters [386, 407]. The last resort therapeutic option is urinary diversion (continent or incontinent) with or 
without cystectomy [410, 415]. Different techniques have been described and the choice between them largely 
depends on the bladder capacity, presence of local symptoms, performance status and expectations of the 
patient. Cystectomy during urinary diversion is able to palliate symptoms of intractable bladder pain, spasms 
and haematuria which are especially prevalent after pelvic radiotherapy [425-428]. The satisfaction rate was 
reported to be 100% and the overwhelming majority of patients would have undergone this extirpative surgery 
an average of thirteen months sooner in a study of fifteen patients by Sack et al., [429]. In a report by Faris 
 
et al., 27% of the patients also required bowel diversion due to intractable gastrointestinal morbidity, 
highlighting the complexity of this pathology [415].",
