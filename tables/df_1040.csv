"4.1.4.1.5.2	Bladder training
Bladder training (BT) is a programme of patient education along with a scheduled voiding regimen with 
gradually increasing intervals. Specific goals are to correct faulty patterns of frequent urination, improve control 
over bladder urgency, prolong voiding intervals, increase bladder capacity, reduce incontinent episodes and 
restore patient confidence in controlling bladder function. The ideal form or intensity of a BT programme for 
OAB/UI is unclear.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Reduction of caffeine intake may reduce symptoms of frequency and urgency.,2
Reduction in fluid intake by 25% may help improve symptoms of OAB but not UI.,1b
"Personalised fluid intake advice when added to pharmacotherapy provides no additional benefit in 
patients with OAB.",2
"Obesity is a risk factor for UI in women, but the relationship to other OAB symptoms remains unclear.",1b
There is weak evidence that smoking cessation improves symptoms of OAB.,3
