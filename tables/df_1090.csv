Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) aimed at pelvic floor muscle relaxation to women 
with functional bladder outlet obstruction (BOO).",Weak
"Prioritise research that investigates and advances understanding of the mechanisms and 
impact of PFMT on the coordinated relaxation of the pelvic floor during voiding.",Strong
"Offer the use of a vaginal pessary to women with grade three or four cystocoeles and BOO 
who are not eligible/inclined towards other treatment options.",Weak
"Offer urinary containment devices to women with BOO to address urinary leakage as a
