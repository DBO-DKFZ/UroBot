"9.3.2.4.3.4	Subcutaneous penile implant
Recently, a silicone penile implant called “Penuma®” (International Medical Devices [Beverly Hills, CA, USA]) 
has been approved and has shown promising results for penile girth enhancement. Penuma® is a soft silicone 
subcutaneous implant placed on 3/4 of the penile shaft and fixed to the glans with a polyester mesh [1545]. 
Studies have reported an average increase in penile circumference of 2 to 5 cm with Penuma® insertion. 
According to published data complication rates (usually mild and transient, occur in <5%) and the removal rate 
(1%) of the implant has been reported to be relatively low [1545, 1549].",
