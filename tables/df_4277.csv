Summary of evidence,LE
The combination of pelvic fracture and visible haematuria is highly suggestive of bladder injury.,3
"Cystography is the preferred diagnostic modality for non-iatrogenic bladder injury and for suspected 
IBT in the post-operative setting.",3
"Cystography must be performed using retrograde filling of the bladder with a minimum volume of  
300-350 mL of dilute contrast material. Passive bladder filling by clamping the urinary catheter during 
the excretory phase of CT or IVP is not sufficient to exclude bladder injury.",3
