Autologous fat and hyaluronic acid as bulking agents have a higher risk of adverse events.,1a
Adverse event rates for urethral bulking agents are lower compared to open surgery.,2a
There is no evidence that one type of bulking agent is better than another.,1b
"The peri-urethral route of injection of bulking agents may be associated with a higher risk of urinary 
retention compared to the transurethral route.",2b
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer urethral bulking agents to women seeking surgical treatment for stress urinary 
incontinence (SUI) following a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits relative to other 
surgical modalities.",Strong
"Offer urethral bulking agents to women with SUI who request a low-risk procedure with the 
understanding that efficacy is lower than other surgical procedures, repeat injections are 
likely, and long-term durability and safety are not established.",Strong
"Do not offer autologous fat and hyaluronic acid as urethral bulking agents due to the higher 
risk of adverse events.",Strong
