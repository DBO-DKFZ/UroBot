"3.7.2	
Male breast cancer
In vitro and in vivo studies have clearly documented that breast cancer growth is significantly influenced by 
testosterone and/or by its conversion to E2 through different mechanisms and pathways [143]. Accordingly, 
the use of SERMs still represents an important therapeutic option in the management of this cancer [143]. 
No information is available on the role of testosterone therapy in patients successfully treated for male breast 
cancer; therefore, treated and active male breast cancer should be recognised as absolute contraindications 
for testosterone therapy.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Treat, when indicated, organic causes of hypogonadism (e.g., pituitary masses, 
hyperprolactinemia, etc).",Strong
"Improve lifestyle and reduce weight (e.g., obesity); withdraw, when possible, concomitant 
drugs that can impair testosterone production; treat co-morbidity before starting 
testosterone therapy.",Weak
"Fully inform patients about expected benefits and adverse effects of any treatment option. 
Select the testosterone preparation in a joint decision process, only with fully informed 
patients.",Strong
"The aim of testosterone therapy is to restore serum testosterone concentration to the 
therapeutic range for young men.",Weak
"Use testosterone gels rather than long-acting depot administration when starting initial 
treatment, so that therapy can be adjusted or stopped in the case of treatment-related 
adverse effects.",Weak
