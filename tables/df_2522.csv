Table 5.1: Bosniak classification of renal cysts [142],,
"Bosniak 
category",Features,Work-up
I,"Simple benign cyst with a hairline-thin wall without septa, calcification, 
or solid components. Same density as water and does not enhance with 
contrast medium.",Benign
II,"Benign cyst that may contain a few hairline-thin septa. Fine calcification 
may be present in the wall or septa. Uniformly high-attenuation lesions  
< 3 cm in size, with sharp margins without enhancement.",Benign
IIF,"These may contain more hairline-thin septa. Minimal enhancement of 
a hairline-thin septum or wall. Minimal thickening of the septa or wall. 
The cyst may contain calcification, which may be nodular and thick, 
with no contrast enhancement. No enhancing soft-tissue elements. 
This category also includes totally intra-renal, non-enhancing, high 
attenuation renal lesions > 3 cm. Generally well-marginated.","Follow-up, up to 
five years. Some are 
malignant."
III,"These are indeterminate cystic masses with thickened irregular walls or 
septa with enhancement.","Surgery or AS – see 
Chapter 7. Over 50% 
are malignant."
IV,Clearly malignant containing enhancing soft-tissue components.,"Surgery. Most are 
malignant."
