Targeted therapies
Beyond chemotherapy, currently limited additional systemic options exist. Specific actionable genetic 
alterations appear rare in this disease. Targeted therapy against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has 
been tested, similar to SCCs originating from other anatomical regions.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Low-level data support the use of platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line systemic therapy in 
advanced disease.",3
"Effective second-line palliative chemotherapy regimens are lacking. Second-line chemotherapy in 
multiple studies was associated with median OS of six months or less.",3
"Initial phase II or basket studies assessed anti-EGFR therapy or checkpoint inhibition, as monotherapy 
or combination therapy, in advanced disease. Early evidence of promising clinical activity has been 
reported in patients with penile cancer.",2b
