Summary of evidence and guidelines for the primary assessment of non-muscle-,
"Once a bladder tumour has been detected, perform a CT urography in selected cases (e.g., 
tumours located in the trigone, multiple- or high-risk tumours).",Strong
"Perform cystoscopy in patients with symptoms suggestive of bladder cancer or during 
surveillance. It cannot be replaced by cytology or by any other non-invasive test.",Strong
"In men, use a flexible cystoscope, if available, and apply irrigation ‘bag squeeze’ to 
decrease procedural pain when passing the proximal urethra.",Strong
"Describe all macroscopic features of the tumour (site, size, number, and appearance) and 
mucosal abnormalities during cystoscopy. Use a bladder diagram (Figure 5.1).",Strong
Use voided urine cytology as an adjunct to cystoscopy to detect high-grade tumour.,Strong
"Perform cytology on at least 25 mL fresh urine or urine with adequate fixation. First morning 
urine is not suitable because of the frequent presence of cytolysis.",Strong
Use the Paris System 2nd Edn. for cytology reporting.,Strong
