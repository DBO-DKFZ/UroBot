Treatment of urothelial carcinoma of the prostate
Local conservative treatment with extensive TUR and subsequent BCG instillation is effective in patients with Ta or 
Tis prostatic urethral carcinoma [91]. A systematic review reported patients treated with TURP before BCG show 
a better local response in the prostatic urethra with a higher disease-free survival (80–100% vs. 63–89%) and 
progression free survival (PFS) (90–100% vs. 75–94%) than patients in studies in which no TURP was performed 
[91]. Risk of understaging local extension of prostatic urethral cancer at TUR is high in patients with ductal or 
stromal involvement [92]. Some earlier series have reported superior oncological results for the initial use of radical 
cystoprostatectomy as a primary treatment option in patients with ductal involvement [93, 94]. In 24 patients with 
prostatic stromal invasion treated with radical cystoprostatectomy, a LN mapping study found that twelve patients 
had positive LNs, with an increased proportion located above the iliac bifurcation [95].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Refer patients with advanced urethral carcinoma to academic centres.,Strong
"Discuss treatment of patients with locally-advanced urethral carcinoma within a 
multidisciplinary team of urologists, radiation-oncologists, and oncologists.",Strong
"In locally-advanced urethral carcinoma, use cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimens 
with curative intent prior to surgery.",Weak
"In locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the urethra, offer the combination of 
curative radiotherapy (RT) with radiosensitising chemotherapy for definitive treatment and 
genital preservation.",Weak
Offer salvage surgery or RT to patients with urethral recurrence after primary treatment.,Weak
Offer inguinal lymph node (LN) dissection to patients with limited LN-positive urethral SCC.,Weak
