Details on BT programmes are given in Section 4.2.4. The ICI 2017 [322] concluded that for women with 
UUI or MUI, PFMT and BT are effective first-line conservative therapies. One RCT assigned 108 women with 
diagnoses of SUI (n = 50), UUI (n = 16), or MUI (n = 42) to six weeks of BT and PFMT or BT alone [448]. Overall, 
and in the SUI and MUI subgroups, significantly more patients in the BT and PFMT group reported cure and 
improved symptoms.",
