"6.3.5.1.3.3.2	Prostatic strictures secondary to radiation/high energy sources
Radiotherapy and high-energy modalities (cryoablation, HIFU) might provoke prostatic necrosis, sloughing 
and obstruction [100]. Cases refractory to TUR and with good bladder capacity might be salvaged by 
prostatectomy taking into account the morbidity associated with salvage RP (rectal injury, VUAS, incontinence) 
[100, 423]. Mundy et al., treated nine patients with patency in six, (67%) and one (11%) needing an AUS for 
severe incontinence [410].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Patency rates of urethroplasty for radiation-induced BMS is 80% with no significant differences 
between  EPA and augmentation urethroplasty.",3
Radiation-induced BMS longer than 2-2.5 cm are rarely amenable for EPA.,3
"De novo incontinence and new onset ED after urethral surgery for radiation-induced BMS are reported 
in respectively 19-26% and 0-35% of cases.",3
"Salvage prostatectomy can achieve patency in 67% of patients for prostatic strictures after irradiation 
or high-energy treatments but morbidity is substantial.",4
