Metastatic disease in a first-line setting,,
"M1 patients*
All statements 
are based on 
metastatic disease 
defined by bone 
scintigraphy and  
CT scan/MRI.","Offer immediate systemic treatment with androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT) to palliate symptoms and reduce the risk for potentially serious 
sequelae of advanced disease (spinal cord compression, pathological 
fractures, ureteral obstruction) to M1 symptomatic patients.",Strong
,"At the start of ADT offer luteinising hormone-releasing hormone 
(LHRH) antagonists or orchiectomy to patients with impending clinical 
complications like spinal cord compression or bladder outlet obstruction.",Strong
,"Offer early systemic treatment to M1 patients asymptomatic from their 
tumour.",Strong
,"Offer short-term administration of an older generation androgen 
receptor (AR) antagonist to M1 patients starting LHRH agonist to 
reduce the risk of the ‘flare-up’ phenomenon.",Weak
,Do not offer AR antagonist monotherapy to patients with M1 disease.,Strong
,"Discuss combination therapy including ADT plus systemic therapy 
with all M1 patients.",Strong
,"Do not offer ADT monotherapy to patients whose first presentation is 
M1 disease if they have no contra-indications for combination therapy 
and have a sufficient life expectancy to benefit from combination therapy 
(> 1 year) and are willing to accept the increased risk of side effects.",Strong
,"Offer ADT combined with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or 
apalutamide or enzalutamide to patients with M1 disease and who are 
fit for the regimen.",Strong
,"Offer docetaxel only in combination with ADT plus abiraterone or 
darolutamide to patients with M1 disease and who are fit for docetaxel.",Strong
,"Offer ADT combined with non-curative prostate radiotherapy (using 
doses up to the equivalent of 72 Gy in 2 Gy fractions) to patients 
whose first presentation is M1 disease and who have low volume of 
disease by CHAARTED criteria/M1a disease.",Strong
,"Do not offer ADT combined with any local treatment (RT/surgery) to 
patients with high-volume (CHAARTED criteria) M1 disease outside of 
clinical trials (except for symptom control).",Strong
,"Do not offer ADT combined with surgery to M1 patients outside of 
clinical trials.",Strong
,"Only offer metastasis-directed therapy to M1 patients within a clinical 
trial setting or well-designed prospective cohort study.",Strong
Biochemical recurrence after treatment with curative intent,,
"Biochemical
recurrence (BCR)
after radical
prostatectomy
(RP)","Offer monitoring, including PSA, to EAU Low-Risk BCR patients.",Weak
,"Offer early salvage intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)/volumetric 
arc radiation therapy (VMAT) plus image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) to 
men with two consecutive PSA rises.",Strong
,"A negative positron emission tomography/computed tomography 
(PET/CT) scan should not delay salvage radiotherapy (SRT), if 
otherwise indicated.",Strong
,"Do not wait for a PSA threshold before starting treatment. Once the 
decision for SRT has been made, SRT (at least 64 Gy) should be given 
as soon as possible.",Strong
,Offer hormonal therapy in addition to SRT to men with BCR.,Weak
"BCR after
RT","Offer monitoring, including PSA, to EAU Low-Risk BCR patients.",Weak
,"Only offer salvage radical prostatectomy (SRP), brachytherapy, 
stereotactic body RT, high-intensity focused ultrasound, or 
cryosurgical ablation to highly selected patients with biopsy-proven 
local recurrence within a clinical trial setting or well-designed 
prospective cohort study undertaken in experienced centres.",Strong
"Systemic salvage 
treatment","Do not offer ADT to M0 patients with a PSA-doubling time (DT) > 12 
months.",Strong
