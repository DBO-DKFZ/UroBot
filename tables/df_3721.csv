9.4.1	
Cell-free tissue engineered grafts
These grafts are derived from cadaveric or animal sources (e.g., porcine small intestine submucosa [SIS], 
acellular bladder matrix, acellular dermal matrix), are completely cell-free and serve as a scaffold for host cell 
ingrowth [530]. The main advantage suggested for their use is the off-shelf availability [530].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Prior to catheter removal after urethroplasty, it is important to assess for urinary extravasation with 
urethrography to avoid ensuing complications including peri-urethral inflammation, abscess formation 
and fistulation.",2b
"After uncomplicated DVIU, there is no advantage in maintaining the catheter for a prolonged period.",3
"Early catheter removal may be appropriate for a subset of patients with short, uncomplicated, strictures.",3
