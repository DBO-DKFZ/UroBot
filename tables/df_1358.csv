Diode laser enucleation of the prostate
Mechanism of action: For prostate surgery, diode lasers with a wavelength of 940, 980, 1,318, and 1,470 nm 
(depending on the semiconductor used) are marketed for vaporisation and enucleation. Only a few have been 
evaluated in clinical trials [385].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Laser vaporisation of the prostate using the 120-W 980 nm diode laser demonstrated high intra-
operative safety with regard to haemostatic properties when compared to TURP. Peri-operative 
parameters like catheterisation time and hospital stay were in favour of diode lasers. Evidence is 
limited by the number and quality of the available studies.",1b
"In a number of studies, post-operative complications such as severe storage symptoms and persisting 
incontinence, occurred with laser vaporisation of the prostate using the 120-W 980 nm diode laser.",3
"Laser vaporisation using the 120-W 980 nm diode laser seems to be safe with regard to haemostasis 
in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.",3
