Recommendations,Strength rating
Testicular torsion is a paediatric urological emergency and requires immediate treatment.,Strong
"In neonates with testicular torsion perform orchidopexy of the contralateral testicle. In 
prenatal torsion the timing of surgery is usually dictated by clinical findings.",Weak
"Base the clinical decision on physical examination. The use of Doppler ultrasound to 
evaluate acute scrotum is useful, but this should not delay the intervention.",Strong
"Manage torsion of the appendix testis conservatively. Perform surgical exploration in 
equivocal cases and in patients with persistent pain.",Strong
"Perform urgent surgical exploration in all cases of testicular torsion within 24 hours of 
symptom onset. In prenatal torsion the timing of surgery is usually dictated by clinical 
findings.",Strong
