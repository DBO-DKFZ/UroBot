Intra-prostatic injections
Mechanism of action: Various substances have been injected directly into the prostate in order to improve 
LUTS including Botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A), fexapotide triflutate (NX-1207) and PRX302. The primary 
mechanism of action of BoNT-A is through the inhibition of neurotransmitter release from cholinergic neurons 
[525]. The mechanisms of action for the injectables NX-1207 and PRX302 are not completely understood, but 
experimental data suggest apoptosis-induced atrophy of the prostate with both drugs [525].",
Summary of evidence,LE
No clinical trial of pathophysiology-directed primary therapy has been undertaken.,4
No robust clinical trial of behavioural therapy as primary intervention has been undertaken.,4
"Antidiuretic therapy reduces nocturnal voiding frequency in men with baseline severity of two or more 
voids per night.",1b
"There is an increased risk of hyponatremia in patients 65 years of age or older under antidiuretic 
therapy.",1b
Antidiuretic therapy increases duration of undisturbed sleep.,1b
"Alpha 1-blocker use is associated with improvements in undisturbed sleep duration and nocturnal 
voiding frequency, which are generally of only marginal clinical significance.",2
"Antimuscarinic medications can reduce night-time urinary urgency severity, but the reduction in overall 
nocturia frequency is small or non-significant.",2
Antimuscarinic medications are associated with higher incidence of dry mouth compared with placebo.,2
"5α-reductase inhibitors reduce nocturia severity in men with baseline nocturia severity of two or more 
voids per night.",2
"A trial of timed diuretic therapy may be offered to men with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria. 
Screening for hyponatremia should be undertaken at baseline and during treatment.",1b
