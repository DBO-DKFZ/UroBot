Risk Groups,Presentation,Initial treatment,Comment,Follow-up
High,"Symptomatic male 
or female patients 
after toilet-training 
with high-grade 
reflux (grades IV-V), 
abnormal kidneys and 
LUTD","Initial treatment is 
always for LUTD with 
CAP; intervention 
may be considered in 
cases of BT infections 
or persistent reflux","Greater possibility of 
earlier intervention","More aggressive 
follow-up for UTI 
and LUTD; full 
re-evaluation after  
6 months"
High,"Symptomatic male 
or female patients 
after toilet-training 
with high-grade 
reflux (grade IV-V), 
abnormal kidneys and 
no LUTD","Intervention should be 
considered","Reimplantation has 
better results than 
endoscopic surgery","Post-operative VCUG 
on indication only; 
follow-up of kidney 
status until after 
puberty"
Moderate,"Symptomatic male 
or female patients 
before toilet-training, 
with high-grade reflux 
and abnormal kidneys","CAP is the 
initial treatment. 
Intervention may be 
considered in cases 
of BT infections or 
persistent reflux","Spontaneous 
resolution is higher in 
males","Follow-up for UTI/ 
hydronephrosis; full 
re-evaluation after 
12-24 months"
Moderate,"Asymptomatic 
patients (PNH or 
sibling) with high-
grade reflux and 
abnormal kidneys","CAP is the 
initial treatment. 
Intervention may be 
considered in cases 
of BT, infections or 
persistent reflux",,"Follow-up for UTI/ 
hydronephrosis; full 
re-evaluation after 
12-24 months"
Moderate,"Symptomatic male or 
female patients after 
toilet-training, with 
high-grade reflux and 
normal kidneys with 
LUTD","Initial treatment is 
always for LUTD with 
CAP. Intervention 
may be considered in 
cases of BT infections 
or persistent reflux","In case of persistent 
LUTD, despite 
urotherapy, 
intervention should 
be considered. The 
choice of intervention 
is controversial","Follow-up for UTI and 
LUTD, kidney status; 
full re-evaluation after 
successful urotherapy"
Moderate,"Symptomatic male 
or female patients 
after toilet-training 
with low-grade reflux, 
abnormal kidneys 
with or without LUTD","Choice of treatment 
is controversial. 
Endoscopic treatment 
may be an option. 
LUTD treatment 
should be given if 
needed",,"Follow-up for UTI, 
LUTD, and kidney 
status until after 
puberty"
Moderate,"All symptomatic 
patients with normal 
kidneys, with low-
grade reflux, with 
LUTD","Initial treatment is 
always for LUTD with 
or without CAP",,"Follow-up for UTI and 
LUTD"
Low,"All symptomatic 
patients with normal 
kidneys, with low-
grade reflux, with no 
LUTD",No treatment or CAP,"If no treatment is 
given, parents should 
be informed about 
risk of infection",Follow-up for UTI

patients with normal 
kidneys with low-
