Disease management
Since many of these patients are unstable, the urologist’s initial responsibility is to provide a method of draining 
and monitoring urine output.
A transurethral catheter should only be inserted if there is a history of voiding after the traumatic 
event, and if a rectal and pelvic examination, as described above, has not suggested a urethral rupture. If the 
catheter does not pass easily, an immediate retrograde urethrogram should be performed. A suprapubic tube 
may be placed in the emergency department percutaneously, or even in the operating room, if the patient has 
to undergo immediate exploration because of other life-threatening injuries.
There are often no associated injuries with a bulbous urethral or straddle injury and management 
is therefore usually straightforward. In these cases, a transurethral catheter is the best option for preventing 
urethral bleeding and/or painful voiding [1468].
The initial management of posterior urethral injuries remains controversial, mainly regarding the 
long-term results with primary realignment compared to simple suprapubic drainage with later reconstruction.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Use retrograde cystography to diagnose suspected bladder injuries.,Strong
"Ensure that the bladder has been filled to its full capacity and an additional film is taken 
after drainage.",Strong
"Manage extra-peritoneal bladder ruptures conservatively with a transurethral catheter left in 
place for seven to ten days.",Strong
"Do not delay treatment of intra-peritoneal bladder ruptures by surgical exploration and 
repair as well as post-operative drainage for seven to ten days.",Strong
