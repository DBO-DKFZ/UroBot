Comparison of grafts with flaps
One small RCT (LS excluded) comparing OMG with PSF found no significant difference in urethral patency rate 
[502]. Penile skin flaps had a higher urogenital morbidity (superficial penile skin necrosis, penile torsion, penile 
hypoesthesia, and post-void dribbling) and longer operation time compared to OMG. Furthermore, patient 
dissatisfaction was significantly higher with penile flaps [502]. Another small RCT (LS excluded) comparing 
penile skin grafts with PSF confirmed these findings with longer operation time and more superficial penile skin 
necrosis in the group of the flaps, whereas the urethral patency rate was similar between both groups [355]. 
Several retrospective series also found a comparable urethral patency rate between PSF and grafts [272, 274, 
503, 504] (Table 9.1).",
