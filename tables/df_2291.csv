"Recommendations 
Strength rating",,,,,
Radical prostatectomy (RP),,,,,
"Offer RP to patients with cN0 disease as part of multi-modal therapy. 
Weak",,,,,
Extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND),,,,,
"Perform an ePLND. 
Strong",,,,,
Radiotherapeutic treatments,,,,,
"Offer patients with cN0 disease intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)/volumetric 
modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plus image-guide radiation therapy in combination with  
long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).",Strong,,,,
"Offer patients with cN0 disease and good urinary function, IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT with 
brachytherapy boost (either high-dose rate or low-dose rate), in combination with long-term 
ADT.",Weak,,,,
Offer long-term ADT for at least 2 years.,Strong,,,,
"Offer IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT to the prostate in combination with long-term ADT and 2 years 
of abiraterone to cN0M0 patients with > 2 high-risk factors (cT3-4, Gleason > 8 or PSA > 40 
ng/mL).",Strong,,,,
"Offer IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT to the prostate plus pelvis in combination with long-term ADT 
and 2 years of abiraterone to cN1M0 patients.",Strong,,,,
"Offer patients with cN1 disease a local treatment (either RP or IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT) plus 
long-term ADT.",Strong,,,,
Therapeutic options outside surgery or radiotherapy,,,,,
"Do not offer whole gland treatment or focal treatment.
