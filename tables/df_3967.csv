Table 3.12 Radiation protection measures
"• 
Limit studies or intervention involving radiation exposure to those that are strictly medically necessary."
"• 
Implement a patient electronic record of medical imaging."
"• 
Make use of imaging studies with lower radiation doses (US, KUB, digital tomosynthesis, low-dose and 
ultra-low dose CT scan)."
"• 
Create and follow a precise radiation exposure protection protocol in your department."
"• 
Act in accordance with the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle."
"• 
Measure and report fluoroscopy time to the operative surgeon (use dosimeters and perform monthly 
calculations)."
"• 
Technical measures to reduce radiation exposure include:
Reducing fluoroscopy time;
 
Limiting time adjacent to patient; 
 
Using low-dose radiation; 
 
Irradiating only to observe motion;
 
Intra-operative use of pulsed fluoroscopy;
 
Reduced fluoroscopy pulse rate;
 
Collimated fields;
 
Avoid digital image acquisition and rely on last image hold and instant replay technology.
 "
"• 
Use radiation protection instruments (chest, pelvic and thyroid shields, lead or lead-free gloves, 
protective glasses, lead protection under the operating table between the x-ray source and the surgeon)."
"• 
The radiation protection instruments must be cared for appropriately as any damage decreases 
effectiveness and increases exposure risk.  They should be monitored and measured regularly to ensure 
integrity."
"• 
Proper surgeon and operating room setup should be observed (follow the inverse square law, use the 
X-ray source underneath the patient’s body, decrease the X-ray source to patient distance, reduce 
magnification, avoid field overlap by not turning the C-arm in extreme angles, operate in the standing 
rather than the seated position)."
