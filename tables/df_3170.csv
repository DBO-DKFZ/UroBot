Disease management
Before commencing any treatment, it is essential to define the subtype of PE and discuss patient’s 
expectations thoroughly. Pharmacotherapy must be considered the first-line treatment for patients with lifelong 
PE, whereas treating the underlying cause (e.g., ED, prostatitis, LUTS, anxiety and hyperthyroidism) must be 
the initial goal for patients with acquired PE [228]. Various behavioural techniques may be beneficial in treating 
variable and subjective PE [770]. Psychotherapy can also be considered for PE patients who are uncomfortable 
with pharmacological therapy or in combination with pharmacological therapy [771, 772]. However, there is 
weak and inconsistent evidence regarding the effectiveness of these psychosexual interventions and their long-
term outcomes in PE are unknown [773].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Perform the diagnosis and classification of premature ejaculation (PE) based on medical 
and sexual history, which should include assessment of intravaginal ejaculatory latency time 
(IELT) (self-estimated), perceived control, distress and interpersonal difficulty due to the 
ejaculatory dysfunction.",Strong
Use either stopwatch measured IELT or self-estimated IELT in clinical practice.,Weak
Use patient-reported outcomes in daily clinical practice.,Weak
"Include physical examination in the initial assessment of PE to identify anatomical 
abnormalities that may be associated with PE or other sexual dysfunctions, particularly 
erectile dysfunction.",Strong
"Do not perform routine laboratory or neuro-physiological tests. They should only be directed 
by specific findings from history or physical examination.",Strong
