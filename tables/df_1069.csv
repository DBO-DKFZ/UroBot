"4.2.4.3.2.4	Laser treatment
A SR including sixteen published studies, involving 899 patients with SUI, evaluated effects of laser treatment. 
The change in the ICIQ-SF score at one, two, and six months was -5.49, -4.97, and -5.48, respectively. The 
improvement in a 1-hour pad weight test results at one, three-, and twelve-months post treatment was -5.59, 
-4.96, and -5.82, respectively. The Pelvic organ prolapse/UI sexual questionnaire (PISQ-12) score increased by 
5.39 (95% CI: 1.20-9.58) following treatment. Subgroup analysis identified the type and severity of UI as the 
potential source of heterogeneity. Adverse effects were reported in six of the sixteen trials and affected only 
a small number of patients. Most adverse events were mild or moderate and required no medical intervention 
or resolved in a few days. According to this SR, vaginal laser therapy appears to be a safe, effective, and 
minimally-invasive treatment option for SUI that can be well tolerated by patients [383].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Urethral bulking agents may provide short-term improvement and cure in women with SUI.,1b
"Bulking agents are less effective than MUS, Burch colposuspension or autologous sling for cure of SUI 
and repeat injections may be required in order to achieve sustained benefits.",1b
Autologous fat and hyaluronic acid as bulking agents have a higher risk of adverse events.,1a
Adverse event rates for urethral bulking agents are lower compared to open surgery.,2a
There is no evidence that one type of bulking agent is better than another.,1b
"The peri-urethral route of injection of bulking agents may be associated with a higher risk of urinary 
retention compared to the transurethral route.",2b
