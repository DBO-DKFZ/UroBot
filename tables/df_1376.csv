Sacral nerve stimulation (neuromodulation)
Mechanism of action: Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) delivers low amplitude electrical impulses to the sacral 
nerve roots via an electrode implanted adjacent to the third sacral nerve root and connected to an attached 
pulse generator implanted in the buttocks. It works by modulating neural activity thus stabilising bladder 
electrical activity through an unknown mechanism. It is a two-stage process: in the first stage, a tined lead 
electrode is placed percutaneously near the S3 root and linked to an external stimulator to assess the 
response. If symptoms reduced more than 50%, patients are candidates for the second stage which is the full 
implant.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer bladder wall injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (100 U) to patients with overactive 
bladder/urge urinary incontinence refractory to medical therapy.",Weak
"Warn patients of the limited duration of response, risk of urinary tract infection and the 
possible prolonged need for clean intermittent self-catheterisation (ensure that they are 
willing and able to do so).",Strong
