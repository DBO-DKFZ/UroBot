Table 5: Pathological risk-factors for occult metastatic disease in stage I testicular cancer,
"Perform contrast enhanced computerised tomography (CECT) scan (chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis) in patients with a diagnosis of TC. In case of iodine allergy or other limiting factors 
perform abdominal and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",Strong
"Perform MRI of the brain (or brain CECT if not available) in patients with multiple lung 
metastases, or high beta subunit of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β-hCG) values, or those in 
the poor-prognosis International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) risk group.",Strong
Do not use positron emission tomography–computed tomography or bone scan for staging.,Strong
"Encourage patients with TC to perform self-examination and to inform first-degree male 
relatives of the need for self-examination.",Weak
"Discuss testis-sparing surgery with frozen section examination in patients with a high 
likelihood of having a benign testicular tumour which are suitable for enucleation.",Strong
"Discuss biopsy of the contralateral testis to patients with TC and who are at high-risk for 
contralateral germ cell neoplasia “in situ”.",Strong
Summary of evidence,LE
"Patients with stage I seminoma have, in general, a low risk of recurrence",2a
"Primary testicular tumour size correlates with the risk of relapse. Stromal rete testis invasion and other 
factors such as vascular invasion or epididymal invasion show a less reliable correlation with the risk 
of relapse.",2a
"The evidence to guide adjuvant treatment decisions upon risk factors is, however, still too limited to 
justify routine use in clinical practice.",2a
"Active surveillance is a feasible approach with conditional relapse risk in unselected series of between 
12-20%.",2a
