Therapeutic vaccination
Three different vaccines against HPV have been licensed to date, but routine vaccination of males is currently 
implemented in only a few countries including Australia, Canada, the USA and Austria16. The aim of male 
vaccination is to reduce the rate of anal and penile cancers as well as head and neck cancers [415, 443]. 
A systematic review including a total of 5,294 patients reported vaccine efficacy against persisting 
(at least six months) anogenital HPV16 infections of 46.9% (28.6-60.8%) and against persisting oral infections 
of 88% (2–98%). A vaccine efficacy of 61.9% (21.4–82.8%) and 46.8% (20-77.9%) was observed against 
anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and 3 lesions, respectively [415]. The systematic review reported no 
meaningful estimates on vaccine efficacy against penile intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3, and no data were 
identified for anal, penile or head and neck squamous cell cancers [415]. 
A phase III clinical trial including 180 male patients evaluated the potential of MVA E2 recombinant 
vaccinia virus to treat intraepithelial lesions associated with papillomavirus infection [444]. the study showed 
promising results in terms of immune system stimulation against HPV lesions as well as regression in 
intraepithelial lesions.",
Summary of evidence,LE
HPV vaccine is effective in the prevention of external genital lesions and genital warts in males.,1a
"HPV vaccination is moderately effective against genital HPV-related diseases irrespective of a 
individuals HPV status; however, higher vaccine efficacy was observed in HPV-naïve males.",1a
"A systematic review of HPV vaccination barriers among adolescent and young adult males identified 
a number of barriers to vaccine uptake including fear of side-effects, limited HPV awareness, financial 
costs and changes in sexual activity.",1b
"An intervention study to evaluate whether electronic messaging can increase HPV completion and 
knowledge among college students concluded that intervention increased knowledge but not vaccine 
completion.",2b
