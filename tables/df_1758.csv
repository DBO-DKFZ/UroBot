Paediatric ureteral trauma
Injuries to the ureter are rare. The ureter is well protected; the upper part is protected by its close 
approximation to the vertebral column and paraspinal muscles and the lower part by its route through the 
bony pelvis. In addition, the ureter is a small target, and both flexible and mobile. This also means that ureteral 
injuries are caused more often by penetrating trauma than blunt trauma [1458]. Since the ureter is the sole 
conduit for urinary transport between the kidney and the bladder, any ureteral injury can threaten the function 
of the ipsilateral kidney.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Use imaging in all children who have sustained a blunt or penetrating trauma with any level 
of haematuria, especially when the history reveals a deceleration trauma, direct flank trauma 
or a fall from a height.",Strong
"Use rapid spiral computed tomography with delayed images scanning for diagnostic and 
staging purposes.",Strong
Manage most injured kidneys conservatively.,Strong
Offer surgical intervention in case of haemodynamic instability and a Grade V renal injury.,Strong
