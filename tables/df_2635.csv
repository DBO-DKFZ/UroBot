Organ preservation
In kidneys donated after cardiac death (DCD) evidence suggests that warm ischemia contributes to worse 
graft outcome. Donor haemodynamic parameters (systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation and shock index: 
heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure) may be predictors of delayed graft function (DGF) and graft 
failure; however, further studies are required to validate this [26]. The duration of asystolic warm ischaemia 
during procurement in DCD donors is associated with increased risk of graft failure. Overall five year graft 
failure (including primary graft non-function) was associated with longer asystolic warm ischaemia times 
[27]. Extraction time (beginning with aortic cross-clamp and ending with placement of the kidneys on ice), is 
an important factor for DGF
. Incidents of DGF were 27.8% and 60% at up to 60 minutes and 120 minutes 
extraction time, respectively [28]. 
A retrospective study of 64,024 living donor kidney transplants found that cold ischaemia time (CIT), 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch, donor age, panel reactive antibody, recipient diabetes, donor and 
recipient body mass index (BMI), recipient race and gender, right nephrectomy, open nephrectomy, dialysis 
status, ABO incompatibility, and previous transplants were independent predictors of DGF in living donor 
kidney transplants [29]. Five-year graft survival among living donor kidney transplant recipients with DGF was 
significantly lower than in those without DGF
. Delayed graft function increased the risk of graft failure by more 
than two-fold [29].",
