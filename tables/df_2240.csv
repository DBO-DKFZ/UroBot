General guidelines for the treatment of prostate cancer*",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"No active treatment modality has shown superiority over any other active management 
options or deferred active treatment in terms of overall- and PCa-specific survival for 
clinically localised low/intermediate-risk disease.",Strong
"Offer a watchful waiting policy to asymptomatic patients with clinically localised disease 
and with a life expectancy < 10 years (based on co-morbidities and age).",Strong
Inform patients that all local treatments have side effects.,Strong
Surgical treatment,
"Radical prostatectomy (RP) can be safely delayed for at least 3 months from diagnosis in 
any risk category.",Weak
"Inform patients that no surgical approach (open-, laparoscopic- or robotic RP) has clearly 
shown superiority in terms of functional or oncological results.",Weak
"When a lymph node dissection (LND) is deemed necessary based on a nomogram, perform 
an extended LND template for optimal staging.",Strong
"Consider avoiding nerve-sparing surgery when there is a risk of ipsilateral extra-capsular 
extension (based on cT stage, ISUP grade, magnetic resonance imaging, or with this 
information combined in a nomogram).",Weak
Do not offer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy before surgery.,Strong
Radiotherapeutic treatment,
"Offer intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric arc radiation therapy 
(VMAT) plus image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) for definitive treatment of PCa by 
external-beam radiation therapy.",Strong
"Offer moderate hypofractionation (HFX) with IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT to the prostate to 
patients with localised disease (60 Gy/20 fractions in 4 weeks or 70 Gy/28 fractions in  
6 weeks).",Strong
"Offer low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy monotherapy to patients with good urinary 
function and low-risk or NCCN favourable intermediate-risk disease.",Strong
"Offer LDR or high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost combined with IMRT/VMAT plus 
IGRT to patients with good urinary function and NCCN unfavourable intermediate-risk or 
high-risk disease and/or locally-advanced disease.",Weak
Active therapeutic options outside surgery or radiotherapy,
"Offer whole-gland cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound within a clinical trial 
Strong
setting or well-designed prospective cohort study.",
