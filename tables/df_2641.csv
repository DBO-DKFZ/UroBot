Summary of evidence and recommendations",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Do not base decisions on the acceptance of a donor organ on histological findings alone, 
since this might lead to an unnecessary high rate of discarded grafts. Interpret histology 
in context with clinical parameters of donor and recipient including perfusion parameters 
where available.",Strong
"Use paraffin histology for histomorphology as it is superior to frozen sections; however, its 
diagnostic value has to be balanced against a potential delay of transplantation.",Strong
"Procurement biopsies should be read by a renal pathologist or a general pathologist with 
specific training in kidney pathology.",Strong
