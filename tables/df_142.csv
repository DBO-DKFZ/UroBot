Summary of evidence and guidelines for radical inguinal lymph node dissection in cN1-2 disease,
Summary of evidence,LE
Open radical ILND is the standard for cN1–2 disease.,2a
Radical inguinal lymph node dissection carries a significant risk of complications (21–55%).,2a
"A single study reported on fsILND, fascial-sparing ILND has been reported (single study) and in cN1–2 
disease which appears to offer similar oncological outcomes, and reduced complications.",2b
"Lymph node yield and LND appear related to survival, however, variance in accepted values, 
pathological assessment, and stage migration prevent recommendation of a specific LN count.",2a
Delay in nodal management of more than three to six months may affect DFS.,3
"Minimally-invasive approaches for ILND (VEIL/RAVEIL) generally have longer operative times, 
equivalent LN yields, shorter length of hospital stay and lower wound complications when 
compared with open ILND. However, since current evidence is very limited in cN1–2 patients, no 
recommendation for minimally-invasive approaches can be provided.",2b
Recommendations,Strength rating
"In patients with cN1 disease offer either ipsilateral:
• 
fascial-sparing inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) 
• 
open radical ILND; sparing the saphenous vein, if possible",Strong
"In patients with cN2 disease offer ipsilateral open radical ILND; sparing the saphenous vein, 
if possible.",Strong
Offer minimally-invasive ILND to patients with cN1–2 disease only as part of a clinical trial.,Strong
"Offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy as an alternative approach to upfront surgery to selected 
patients with bulky mobile inguinal nodes or bilateral disease (cN2) who are candidates for 
cisplatin and taxane-based chemotherapy (see Section 6.4.1).",Weak
"Complete surgical inguinal and pelvic nodal management within three months of diagnosis 
(unless the patient has undergone prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy).",Weak
