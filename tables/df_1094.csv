Offer sacral neuromodulation to women with functional BOO.,Weak
"Advise women with voiding symptoms associated with pelvic organ prolapse that

"Offer urethral dilatation to women with urethral stenosis causing BOO but advise on the 
likely need for repeated intervention.",Weak

previously undergone mid-urethral synthetic tape insertion due to the theoretical risk of 
causing urethral mesh extrusion.",Weak

and quality of life) after internal urethrotomy.",Weak
