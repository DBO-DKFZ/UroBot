Pharmacological treatment
5.2.1	
Alpha 1-Adrenoceptor antagonists (α1-blockers)
Mechanism of action: Alpha 1-blockers aim to inhibit the effect of endogenously released noradrenaline on 
smooth muscle cells in the prostate and thereby reduce prostate tone and BOO [143]. However, α1-blockers have 
little effect on urodynamically determined bladder outlet resistance [144], and treatment-associated improvement 
of LUTS correlates poorly with obstruction [145]. Thus, other mechanisms of action may also be relevant.
Alpha 1-adrenoceptors located outside the prostate (e.g. urinary bladder and/or spinal cord) 
and α1-adrenoceptor subtypes (α1B- or α1D-adrenoceptors) may play a role as mediators of effects. Alpha 
1-adrenoceptors in blood vessels, other non-prostatic smooth muscle cells, and the central nervous system 
may mediate adverse events.
Currently available α1-blockers are: alfuzosin hydrochloride (alfuzosin); doxazosin mesylate 
(doxazosin); silodosin; tamsulosin hydrochloride (tamsulosin); terazosin hydrochloride (terazosin); and 
naftopidil. Alpha 1-blockers exist in different formulations. Although different formulations result in different 
pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, the overall difference in clinical efficacy between the difference 
formulations seems negligible.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"After two to four years of treatment, 5-ARIs improve IPSS by approximately 15-30%, de-crease 
prostate volume by 18-28%, and increase Qmax by 1.5-2.0 mL/s in patients with LUTS due to prostate 
enlargement.",1b
"5α-reductase inhibitors can prevent disease progression with regard to AUR and the need for surgery. 
Due to 5-ARIs slow onset of action, they are suitable only for long-term treatment (years).",1a
"The most relevant adverse effects of 5-ARIs are related to sexual function, and include reduced libido, 
ED and less frequently, ejaculation disorders such as retrograde ejaculation, ejaculation failure, or 
decreased semen volume.",1b
