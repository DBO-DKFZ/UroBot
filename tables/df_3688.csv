Effectiveness of dilatation compared with direct vision internal urethrotomy
A SR identified only one prospective RCT comparing dilatation with DVIU and failed to detect any differences 
[196, 220]. In a small (n=56) retrospective cohort study, the three-year estimated stricture recurrence-free 
survival was 35.5% and 28% for respectively balloon dilatation and DVIU (p=0.21) [221].",
