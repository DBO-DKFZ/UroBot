Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of 
rUTIs",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Extensive routine workup including cystoscopy, imaging, etc. has a low diagnostic yield for the 
diagnosis of rUTI.",3
"Increased water intake is an effective antimicrobial-sparing strategy to prevent rUTI in premenopausal 
women at high risk for recurrence who drink low volumes (< 1.5 L) of fluid daily.",3
"Vaginal oestrogen replacement has shown a trend towards preventing rUTI in post-menopausal 
women.",1b
"Immunoactive prophylaxis has been shown to be more effective than placebo in female patients with 
rUTIs in several randomised trials with a good safety profile.",1a
"Probiotics containing L. rhamnosus GR-1, L. reuteri B-54 and RC-14, L. casei shirota, or L. crispatus 
CTV-05 are effective for vaginal flora restoration and have shown a trend towards prevention of rUTIs.",1b
"Current scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of cranberry products in the prevention of UTIs is 
inconclusive.",1a
There is contradictory evidence on the efficacy of D-mannose to reduce the number of UTI episodes.,2
"Based on limited evidence intravesical GAG therapy can reduce the number of UTIs per patient per 
year, and prolong the time interval between rUTI episodes.",2
"A RCT demonstrated the non-inferiority of twice-daily methenamine hippurate to daily antibiotic 
prophylaxis.",1b
"Both continuous low-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis and post-coital antimicrobial prophylaxis, have 
been shown to reduce the rate of rUTI.",1b
"A prospective cohort study showed that intermittent self-start therapy is effective, safe and 
economical in women with rUTIs.",2b
