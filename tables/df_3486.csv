Summary of evidence,LE
Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy can improve median survival.,2
"Cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy is the standard of care in advanced or metastatic 
patients fit enough to tolerate cisplatin.",1b
Carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy offers a survival benefit in cisplatin unfit patients.,1b
"Non-platinum combination chemotherapy has not been tested against standard chemotherapy in 
patients who are fit or unfit for cisplatin combination chemotherapy.",4
"Maintenance avelumab is associated with an OS advantage compared with best supportive care in 
patients who did not have disease progression after 4 to 6 cycles of gemcitabine plus either cisplatin 
or carboplatin.",1b
"PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has been approved for patients who have progressed during or after 
previous platinum-based chemotherapy and did not receive previous immune therapy based on the 
results of a phase III trial.",1b
"PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab has been approved for patients that have progressed during or after 
previous platinum-based chemotherapy and did not receive previous immune therapy based on the 
results of a phase II trial.",2a
"PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab has been approved for patients whose disease has progressed during or 
after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and did not receive previous immune therapy based on 
the results of a phase II trial.",2a
"PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has been approved for patients with advanced or metastatic UC 
unfit for platinum-based first-line chemotherapy based on the results of a phase II trial but use of 
pembrolizumab is restricted to PD-L1 positive patients.",2a
"PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab has been approved for patients with advanced or metastatic UC 
unfit for platinum-based first-line chemotherapy based on the results of a phase II trial, but use of 
atezolizumab is restricted to PD-L1 positive patients.",2a
"Erdafitinib was associated with radiological response in platinum-refractory patients with locally-
advanced or metastatic UC and FGFR DNA genomic alterations (FGFR2/3 mutations or FGFR3 fusions).",2a
"Enfortumab vedotin was associated with OS benefit in patients who had previously received platinum-
containing chemotherapy and experienced disease progression during or after treatment with a PD-1 
or PD-L1 inhibitor.",1b
Palliative nephroureterectomy can improve quality of life by controlling symptomatic disease.,3
RNU can confer a survival benefit in highly selected patients.,4
