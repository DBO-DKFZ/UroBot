Recommendations,Strength rating,
"Offer bone protective agents to patients with mCRPC and skeletal metastases to prevent 
osseous complications.",Strong,
"Monitor serum calcium and offer calcium and vitamin D supplementation when prescribing 
either denosumab or bisphosphonates.",Strong,
"Treat painful bone metastases early on with palliative measures such as intensity-modulated 
radiation therapy/volumetric arc radiation therapy plus image-guided radiation therapy and 
adequate use of analgesics.",Strong,
"In patients with spinal cord compression start immediate high-dose corticosteroids and 
assess for spinal surgery followed by irradiation. Offer radiation therapy alone if surgery is 
not appropriate.",Strong,

Recommendations,Strength rating,
"No active treatment modality has shown superiority over any other active management 
options or deferred active treatment in terms of overall- and PCa-specific survival for 
clinically localised low/intermediate-risk disease.",Strong,
"Offer a watchful waiting policy to asymptomatic patients with clinically localised disease 
and with a life expectancy < 10 years (based on co-morbidities and age).",Strong,
Inform patients that all local treatments have side effects.,Strong,
Surgical treatment,,
"Radical prostatectomy can be safely delayed for at least 3 months from diagnosis in any 
risk category.",Weak,
"Inform patients that no surgical approach (open-, laparoscopic- or robotic radical 
prostatectomy) has clearly shown superiority in terms of functional or oncological results.",Weak,
"When a lymph node dissection (LND) is deemed necessary based on a nomogram, perform an 
extended LND template for optimal staging.",Strong,
"Consider avoiding nerve-sparing surgery when there is a risk of ipsilateral extra-capsular 
extension (based on cT stage, ISUP grade, magnetic resonance imaging, or with this 
information combined in a nomogram).",Weak,
Do not offer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy before surgery.,Strong,
Radiotherapeutic treatment,,
"Offer intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric arc radiation therapy 
(VMAT) plus image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) for definitive treatment of PCa by 
external-beam radiation therapy.",Strong,
"Offer moderate hypofractionation (HFX) with IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT to the prostate to 
patients with localised disease (60 Gy/20 fractions in 4 weeks or 70 Gy/28 fractions in  
6 weeks).",Strong,
"Offer low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy monotherapy to patients with good urinary 
function and low-risk or NCCN favourable intermediate-risk disease.",Strong,
"Offer LDR or high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost combined with IMRT/VMAT plus 
IGRT to patients with good urinary function and NCCN unfavourable intermediate-risk or 
high-risk disease and/or locally-advanced disease.",Weak,
Active therapeutic options outside surgery or radiotherapy,,
"Only offer focal therapy with high-intensity focused ultrasound or cryotherapy within a 
Strong
clinical trial or prospective registry.",,

,Selection of patients,
,"Patients with intraductal histology on biopsy should be excluded from 
AS.",Strong
,"Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before a confirmatory 
biopsy if no MRI has been performed before the initial biopsy.",Strong
,"Take both targeted biopsy (of any PI-RADS > 3 lesion) and systematic 
biopsy if a confirmatory biopsy is performed.",Weak
,"If MRI is not available, per-protocol confirmatory prostate biopsies 
should be performed.",Weak
,"If a patient has had upfront MRI followed by systematic and targeted 
biopsies there is no need for confirmatory biopsies.",Weak
