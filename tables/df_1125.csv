Summary of evidence,LE
"Preoperative urodynamic testing in women with uncomplicated, clinically demonstrable, SUI does not 
improve surgical outcome for SUI.",1b
"There is no consistent correlation between urethral function tests and subsequent success or failure of 
SUI surgery.",3
"There is no consistent evidence that preoperative DO is associated with surgical failure of MUS in 
women.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating

cases in which the type of incontinence is unclear, cases in which voiding dysfunction is 
suspected, and cases with associated pelvic organ prolapse or prior surgery for SUI.",Weak
