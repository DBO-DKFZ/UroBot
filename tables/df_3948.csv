Recommendations for investigations for the assessment of patients with stones of unknown 
composition [21, 27, 68, 627]",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Use ultrasound (US) as first-line imaging with symptoms suggestive of a bladder stone.,Strong
"Use cystoscopy or computed tomography (CT), or kidney-ureter-bladder X-Ray (KUB) to 
investigate adults with persistent symptoms suggestive of a bladder stone if US is negative.",Strong
"Use X-Ray KUB for adults with confirmed bladder stones to guide treatment options and 
follow-up.",Weak
"All patients with bladder stones should be examined and investigated for the cause of 
bladder stone formation, including:
• 
uroflowmetry and post-void residual;
• 
urine dipstick, pH, ± culture;
• 
metabolic assessment and stone analysis (see sections 3.3.2.3 and 4.1 of the 
Urolithiasis guidelines for further details).
In selected patients, consider:
• 
upper tract imaging (in patients with a history of urolithiasis or loin pain);
• 
cysto-urethroscopy or urethrogram.",Weak
Offer oral chemolitholysis for radiolucent or known uric acid bladder stones in adults.,Weak
Offer adults with bladder stones transurethral cystolithotripsy where possible.,Strong
"Perform transurethral cystolithotripsy with a continuous flow instrument in adults (e.g., 
nephroscope or resectoscope) where possible.",Weak
"Offer adults percutaneous cystolithotripsy where transurethral cystolithotripsy is not 
possible or advisable.",Strong
"Suggest open cystolithotomy as an option for very large bladder stones in adults and 
children.",Weak
Offer children with bladder stones transurethral cystolithotripsy where possible.,Weak
"Offer children percutaneous cystolithotripsy where transurethral cystolithotripsy is not 
possible or is associated with a high risk of urethral stricture (e.g., young children, previous 
urethral reconstruction, and spinal cord injury).",Weak
"Open, laparoscopic, and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy are alternative treatments 
where endoscopic treatment is not advisable in adults and children.",Weak
"Prefer “tubeless” procedure (without placing a catheter or drain) for children with primary 
bladder stones and no prior infection, surgery, or bladder dysfunction where open 
cystolithotomy is indicated.",Weak
"Individualise imaging follow up for each patient as there is a paucity of evidence. 
Factors affecting follow up will include:
• 
whether the underlying functional predisposition to stone formation can be treated (e.g., 
TURP);
• 
metabolic risk.",Weak
"Recommend regular irrigation therapy with saline solution to adults and children with 
bladder augmentation, continent cutaneous urinary reservoir or neuropathic bladder 
dysfunction, and no history of autonomic dysreflexia, to reduce the risk of stone recurrence.",Weak
