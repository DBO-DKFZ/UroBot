Recommendations for investigations for the assessment of patients with stones of unknown 
composition [21, 27, 68, 627]",
Summary of evidence,LE
"The incidence of bladder stones peaks at three years in children (endemic/primary stones in 
developing countries) and 60 years in adults.",2c
"The aetiology of bladder stones is typically multi-factorial. Bladder stones can be classified as primary 
(endemic), secondary (associated with lower urinary tract abnormalities e.g., BPO, neuropathic 
bladder, foreign body, chronic bacteriuria) or migratory (having formed in the upper tract).",4
"In adults, BOO is the most common pre-disposing factor for bladder stone formation.",2c
"Of men undergoing surgery for BPO, 3-4.7% form bladder stones.",2b
"Metabolic abnormalities are also likely to contribute to bladder stone formation in patients with 
secondary bladder stones.",2b
"Primary (endemic) bladder stones typically occur in children in areas with poor hydration, recurrent 
diarrhoea, and a diet deficient in animal protein. The following measures are proposed to reduce their 
incidence: maintenance of hydration, avoidance of diarrhoea, and a mixed cereal diet with milk and 
Vitamins A and B supplements; with the addition of eggs, meat, and boiled cows’ milk after one year 
of age.",5
"In adults, US has a sensitivity of 20-83% for diagnosing bladder stones.",2b
"In adults, X-ray-KUB has a sensitivity of 21-78%; sensitivity increases with stone size.",2b
Computed tomography has a higher sensitivity than US for the detection of bladder stones.,2b
Cystoscopy has a higher sensitivity than X-ray-KUB or US for the detection of bladder stones.,2b
"Endoscopic bladder stone treatments (trans-urethral or percutaneous) are associated with comparable 
SFRs, but a shorter length of hospital stay, duration of procedure and duration of catheterisation 
compared to open cystolithotomy in adults.",1a
"Stone-free rates are lower in patients treated with SWL than those treated with open or endoscopic 
procedures in both adults and children.",2a
"Transurethral cystolithotripsy is associated with a shorter length of hospital stay, less pain and a 
shorter convalescence period than percutaneous cystolithotripsy in adults.",1b
"Transurethral cystolithotripsy with a nephroscope is quicker than when using a cystoscope with no 
difference in SFR in adults.",1a
"Transurethral cystolithotripsy with a resectoscope is quicker than when using a cystoscope with no 
difference in SFR in adults.",2a
"Mechanical, pneumatic and laser appear equivalent lithotripsy modalities for use in endoscopic 
bladder stone treatments in adults and children.",2a
"Open cystolithotomy without a retropubic drain or urethral catheter (“tubeless”) is associated with a 
shorter length of hospital stay than traditional cystolithotomy and can be performed safely in children 
with primary stones and no prior bladder surgery or infections.",2b
