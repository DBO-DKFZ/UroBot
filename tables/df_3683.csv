Suprapubic catheter
Radiation-induced urethral strictures are a difficult to treat population as stricture-free rates for urethral 
reconstruction are lower compared to those in non-irradiated patients [191]. Fuchs et al., evaluated 75 
patients who were initially treated by suprapubic diversion for radiation-induced isolated BMS [192]. Only 51% 
eventually decided to undergo urethroplasty after a mean follow-up period of 25 months. Although there was 
no significant difference in overall performance status between patients with a chronic suprapubic catheter 
vs. those undergoing urethroplasty, all patients with a poor performance score remained with a suprapubic 
catheter. Patients with concomitant stress urinary incontinence (SUI) opted more often to keep their suprapubic 
catheter as the SUI improved in 61% of cases. On the other hand, patients who kept their suprapubic 
catheter suffered from catheter-related complications in 27% of cases. Urinary diversion by ileal conduit was 
performed in 30% of patients who remained with a suprapubic catheter while this was only the case in 8% 
who underwent urethroplasty. A suprapubic catheter is also an option in frail patients not able to undergo 
surgery or in patients who do not want (further) urethral surgery and are willing to accept the complications of a 
suprapubic catheter [193].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Patients with asymptomatic incidental (> 16 Fr) strictures have a low risk of progression and to 
develop symptoms.",3
"Only half of the patients initially treated with a suprapubic catheter for radiation-induced 
bulbomembranous strictures will proceed with urethroplasty.",3
