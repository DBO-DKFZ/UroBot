Malignancy after renal transplantation
Cancer development after kidney transplant has become a major problem as it is one of the main causes of 
death in this population. Urological cancers, have an increased incidence after kidney transplantation partly 
due to the increasing age of recipients and their prolonged survival after transplantation.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Meta-analysis of tacrolimus and cyclosporine has demonstrated similar outcomes with respect to 
overall patient and graft survival; however, tacrolimus provided better rejection prophylaxis.",1a
"Due to differences in the efficacy and safety profile, the choice of CNI should take into account the 
immunological risk, characteristics, concomitant immunosuppression, and socio-economic factors of 
the recipient.",1
