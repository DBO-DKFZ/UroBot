Table 3:   Comparison between visceral and somatic pain,,
,Visceral pain,Somatic pain
Effective painful stimuli,"Stretching and distension, 
producing poorly localised pain.","Mechanical, thermal, chemical and 
electrical stimuli, producing well 
localised pain."
Summation,"Widespread stimulation produces 
significantly magnified pain.","Widespread stimulation produces a 
modest increase in pain."
Autonomic involvement,"Autonomic features (e.g., nausea 
and sweating) frequently present.",Autonomic features less frequent.
Referred pain,"Pain perceived at a site distant to 
the cause of the pain is common.","Pain is relatively well localised and 
well recognised."
Referred hyperalgesia,"Referred cutaneous and muscle 
hyperalgesia is common, as is 
involvement of other visceral 
organs.",Hyperalgesia tends to be localised.
Innervation,"Low density, unmyelinated C fibres 
and thinly myelinated A∂ fibres.","Dense innervation with a wide 
range of nerve fibres."
Primary afferent physiology,"Intensity coding. As stimulation 
increases, afferent firing increases 
with an increase in sensation and 
ultimately pain.","Two fibre coding. Separate fibres 
for pain and normal sensation."
Silent afferents,"50-90% of visceral afferents 
are silent until the time they are 
switched on.","These fibres are very important in 
the central sensitisation process. 
Silent afferents present, but form a 
lower percentage."
Central mechanisms,"Play an important part in the 
hyperalgesia, viscero-visceral, 
viscero-muscular and musculo-
visceral hyperalgesia.","Sensations not normally perceived 
become perceived and non-
noxious sensations become 
painful. Responsible for the 
allodynia and hyperalgesia of 
chronic somatic pain."
Abnormalities of function,"Central mechanisms associated 
with visceral pain may be 
responsible for organ dysfunction.","Somatic pain associated with 
somatic dysfunction, e.g., muscle 
spasm."
"Central pathways and 
representation","As well as classical pathways, 
there is evidence for a separate 
dorsal horn pathway and central 
representation.",Classical pain pathways.
