Pad testing
Measurement of urine loss using an absorbent pad worn over a set period of time or during a protocol of 
physical exercise can be used to quantify the presence and severity of UI, as well as provide objective 
evidence of response to treatment.",
Summary of evidence,LE
A pad test can diagnose UI accurately.,2
Standardisation of bladder volume and degree of provocation improves reproducibility.,2
"Twenty-four hours is sufficient duration for home-based testing balancing diagnostic accuracy and 
adherence.",1a
Change in leaked urine volume on pad tests can be used to measure treatment outcome.,2
"Pad tests can be a useful tool in the research setting and are an optional investigation in clinical 
practice.",4
