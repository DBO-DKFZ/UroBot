Summary of evidence,LE
"Early diagnosis and treatment are essential in both congenital and acquired neuro-urological disorders 
to prevent irreversible changes within the LUT.",4
"An extensive general history is the basis of evaluation focusing on past and present symptoms 
including urinary, sexual, bowel and neurological function.",4
"Assessment of present and expected future QoL is an essential aspect of the overall management of 
neuro-urological patients and is important to evaluate the effect of any therapy.",2a
"Quality of life assessment should be completed with validated QoL questionnaires for neuro-urological 
patients.",1a
"Bladder diaries provide data on the number of voids, voided volume, urinary incontinence, and 
urgency episodes.",3
"Recommendations
Strength rating",
History taking,
"Take an extensive general history, concentrating on past and present symptoms.",Strong
"Take a specific history for each of the four mentioned functions - urinary, bowel, sexual and 
neurological.",Strong
"Pay special attention to the possible existence of alarm signs (e.g. pain, infection, 
haematuria, fever) that warrant further specific diagnosis.",Strong
Assess quality of life when evaluating and treating neuro-urological patients.,Strong
Use available validated tools for urinary and bowel symptoms in neuro-urological patients.,Strong
Use MSISQ-15 or MSISQ-19 to evaluate sexual function in multiple sclerosis patients.,Strong
Physical examination,
Acknowledge individual patient disabilities when planning further investigations.,Strong
"Describe the neurological status as completely as possible, sensations and reflexes in the 
urogenital area must all be tested.",Strong
Test the anal sphincter and pelvic floor functions.,Strong
"Perform urinalysis, blood chemistry, bladder diary, post-void residual, incontinence 
quantification and urinary tract imaging as initial and routinary evaluation.",Strong
