"6.2.2	
Treatment of intermediate-risk disease
When managed with non-curative intent, intermediate-risk PCa is associated with 10-year and 15-year PCSM 
rates of 13.0% and 19.6%, respectively [841]. These estimates are based on systematic biopsies and may be 
overestimated in the era of MRI-targeted biopsies.",
"Recommendations 
Strength rating",
Watchful Waiting (WW),
"Offer WW in asymptomatic patients with life expectancy < 10 years.
Strong",
Active surveillance (AS),
"Offer AS to highly selected patients with ISUP grade group 2 disease (i.e. < 10% pattern 
4, PSA < 10 ng/mL, < cT2a, low disease extent on imaging and low biopsy extent [defined 
as < 3 positive cores and cancer involvement < 50% core involvement [CI]/per core]), or 
another single element of intermediate-risk disease with low disease extent on imaging and 
low biopsy extent, accepting the potential increased risk of metastatic progression.",Weak
Patients with ISUP grade group 3 disease should be excluded from AS protocols.,Strong
"Re-classify patients with low-volume ISUP grade group 2 disease included in AS protocols, 
if repeat non-MRI-based systematic biopsies performed during monitoring reveal > 3 
positive cores or maximum CI > 50%/core of ISUP 2 disease.",Weak
Radical prostatectomy (RP),
"Offer RP to patients with a life expectancy of > 10 years. 
Strong",
"Radical prostatectomy can be safely delayed for at least 3 months. 
Weak",
"Offer nerve-sparing surgery to patients with a low risk of extra-capsular disease on that side.
Strong",
Extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND),
"Weak
Perform an ePLND based on predicted risk of lymph node invasion (validated nomogram, 
see Section 6.1.2.3.2.)",
Radiotherapeutic treatment,
"Offer low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy to patients with good urinary function and NCCN 
favourable intermediate-risk disease.",Strong
"Offer intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) 
plus image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), with a total dose of 76–78 Gy or moderate 
hypofractionation (60 Gy/20 fx in 4 weeks or 70 Gy/28 fx in 6 weeks), in combination with 
short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (4–6 months).",Strong
