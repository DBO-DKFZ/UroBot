"Table 4.1: UICC/AJCC 8th edition TNM clinical and pathological classification of penile cancer [73, 83]"
Clinical classification
T - Primary Tumour
"TX 
Primary tumour cannot be assessed
T0 
No evidence of primary tumour
Tis 
Carcinoma in situ (Penile Intraepithelial Neoplasia – PeIN)
Ta 
Non-invasive verrucous carcinoma*
T1 
Tumour invades subepithelial connective tissue
T1a 
Tumour invades subepithelial connective tissue without lymphovascular invasion or perineural 
invasion and is not poorly differentiated
T1b 
Tumour invades subepithelial connective tissue with lymphovascular invasion or perineural 
invasion or is poorly differentiated
T2
Tumour invades corpus spongiosum with or without invasion of the urethra 
T3
Tumour invades corpus cavernosum with or without invasion of the urethra
T4
Tumour invades other adjacent structures"
N - Regional Lymph Nodes
"cNX
Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
cN0 
No palpable or visibly enlarged inguinal lymph nodes
cN1 
Palpable mobile unilateral inguinal lymph node
cN2 
Palpable mobile multiple or bilateral inguinal lymph nodes
cN3 
Fixed inguinal nodal mass or pelvic lymphadenopathy, unilateral or bilateral"
M - Distant Metastasis
"cM0 
No distant metastasis
cM1 
Distant metastasis"
Pathological classification
"The pT categories correspond to the clinical T categories. 
The pN categories are based upon biopsy or surgical excision"
pN - Regional Lymph Nodes
"pNX
Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
pN0 
No regional lymph node metastasis
pN1 
Metastasis in one or two inguinal lymph nodes
pN2 
Metastasis in more than two unilateral inguinal nodes or bilateral inguinal lymph nodes
pN3 
Metastasis in pelvic lymph node(s), unilateral or bilateral or extranodal extension of regional lymph 
node metastasis"
pM - Distant Metastasis
"pM1 
Distant metastasis microscopically confirmed"
G - Histopathological Grading
"GX 
Grade of differentiation cannot be assessed
G1 
Well differentiated
G2 
Moderately differentiated
G3
Poorly differentiated 
G4
Undifferentiated"
