Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of obstructive pathology of 
renal duplication: ureterocele and ectopic ureter",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Ureterocele and ectopic ureter are associated with complete renal duplication, but they also occur in a 
single system.",1
"In most cases, in young children (first years of life) diagnosis is done by US.",1
In older children clinical symptoms will prompt assessment.,1
"Management includes a conservative approach, endoscopic decompression, partial 
nephroureterectomy, or complete primary reconstruction. Choice of treatment will depend on:
• 
clinical status of the patient (e.g., urosepsis);
• 
patient age;
• 
function of the upper pole;
• 
presence of reflux or obstruction of the ipsilateral or contralateral ureter;
• 
presence of bladder neck obstruction caused by ureterocele;
• 
intravesical or ectopic ureterocele.",3
