Summary of evidence,LE
"For non-obliterative VUAS and radiation-induced BMS, visually controlled dilatation and DVIU yield a 
patency rate of respectively 0-89% and 25-100% with a low complication rate. It can be performed 
under loco-regional anaesthesia.",3
"During DVIU, deep incision might provoke injury to the rectum at the six o’ clock position and might 
provoke uro-symphyseal fistulation at the twelve o’clock position.",3
