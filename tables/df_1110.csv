Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of urinary fistula",
"Recommendations
Strength rating",
General,
"When reporting on outcomes after fistula repair, authors should make a clear distinction 
between fistula closure rates and postoperative urinary incontinence rates and the time at 
which the follow-up was organised.",Strong
"Do not routinely use ureteric stents as prophylaxis against injury during routine 
gynaecological surgery.",Strong
"Suspect ureteric injury or fistula in patients following pelvic surgery if a fluid leak or 
pelvicalyceal dilatation occurs postoperatively, or if drainage fluid contains high levels of 
creatinine.",Strong
"Use three-dimensional imaging techniques to diagnose and localise urinary fistulae, 
particularly in cases with negative direct visual inspection or cystoscopy.",Weak
"Manage upper urinary tract fistulae initially by conservative or endoluminal techniques 
where such expertise and facilities exist.",Weak
Surgical principles,
"Surgeons involved in fistula surgery should have appropriate training, skills, and experience 
to select an appropriate procedure for each patient.",Weak
"Attention should be given as appropriate to skin care, nutrition, rehabilitation, counselling, 
and support prior to, and following, fistula repair.",Weak
"Tailor the timing of fistula repair to the individual patient and surgeon requirements once any 
oedema, inflammation, tissue necrosis, or infection, are resolved.",Weak
