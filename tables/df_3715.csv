"6.3.5.2.1.2	Endoluminal treatment after failed urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis
In case of a non-obliterative and short (< 1 cm) recurrence after failed urethroplasty, endoluminal treatment can 
be performed [437]. Although a 1st and 2nd DVIU can be successful with a stricture-free rate of 22.9-77.3% and 
0-60% respectively, three or more incisions are never successful (see supplementary Table S6.16) [437-440]. 
Therefore, repetitive endoluminal treatments (dilations and/or endoscopic incisions) can only be considered as 
a palliative option [441].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Female urethral stricture symptoms are long standing and non-specific, the most commonly reported 
are frequency, urgency, poor flow, incomplete emptying, and urinary incontinence. It is important to 
exclude FUS in female patients with LUTS.",3
"Urethral dilatation alone to 24-41 Fr provides low stricture-free rates of mean 40.1% at mean follow-
up 36 (12-59) months.",3
"Isolated repeat dilatation yields patency rates of 26.6%. However, urethral dilatation followed by  ISD 
or regular planned dilatation, as palliation, provides patencyrates of 97% at mean FU 6-21 months.",3
"Urethroplasty provides patency rates of 62.5-100%.  VOBMG and DOBMG reported patency rates are 
92-100% and 62.5-100%, respectively.",3
"Meatotomy/meatoplasty for short meatal strictures has a success rate of 97% at twelve months 
follow-up.",3
