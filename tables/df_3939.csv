Open and laparoscopic/robot-assisted stone surgery
With the advances in ESWL, PNL and RIRS, very few cases of paediatric urolithiasis require open surgery. Data 
extracted from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) databases for 2001-2014 showed that in the USA incisional 
procedures (mainly nephrolithotomy, pyelolithotomy and ureterotomy) were performed in 2.6% of hospitalised 
patients (52% aged 15-17 years) who required surgical intervention for urinary stones [559]. Laparoscopy 
for the management of paediatric renal and ureteric stones is a safe and effective procedure when specific 
indications are followed. Stone free rates of 100% were reported when laparoscopic pyelolithotomy was 
applied for a > 1cm single stone located in an extra-renal pelvis [560], or when laparoscopic ureterolithotomy 
was applied to impacted ureteric stones > 1.5 cm, or to ureteric stones that were refractory to SWL or URS 
[561]. There are extremely limited data available on efficacy and complications of robot-assisted laparoscopic 
management of paediatric urolithiasis [562].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer children with single ureteral stones less than 10 mm shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) if 
localisation is possible or ureteroscopy as first-line option.",Strong
Ureteroscopy is a feasible alternative for ureteral stones not amenable to SWL.,Strong
Offer children with renal stones with a diameter of up to 20 mm (~300 mm2) SWL.,Strong
"Offer children with renal pelvic or calyceal stones with a diameter > 20 mm (~300 mm2) 
percutaneous nephrolithotomy.",Strong
"Retrograde renal surgery is a feasible alternative for renal stones smaller than 20 mm in all 
locations.",Weak
