Chemolysis
Percutaneous irrigation chemolysis
Percutaneous chemolysis is rarely used nowadays, for practical reasons. Percutaneous irrigation chemolysis 
may be an option for infection-stones and theoretically also for uric acid stones. For dissolution of struvite 
stones, Suby’s G solution (10% hemiacidrin; pH 3.5-4) can be used. The method has been described in case 
series and literature reviews [145-147].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Irrigation chemolysis has been used in limited clinical settings to dissolve struvite stones.,3
Uric acid stones > 5mm can be dissolved based on oral alkalinisation of the urine above 7.0.,3
"For obstructing uric acid stones, a combination of oral chemolysis with tamsulosin is more effective 
than each substance alone, particularly in stones > 8 mm.",1b
