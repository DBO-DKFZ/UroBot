"6.2.2.2	
Effectiveness of dilatation compared with direct vision internal urethrotomy
A SR identified only one prospective RCT comparing dilatation with DVIU and failed to detect any differences 
[196, 220]. In a small (n=56) retrospective cohort study, the three-year estimated stricture recurrence-free 
survival was 35.5% and 28% for respectively balloon dilatation and DVIU (p=0.21) [221].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Visually controlled dilatation after endoscopic or fluoroscopic guidewire placement has a low 
complication rate.",3
"Repetitive dilatations/direct vision internal urethrotomy have no long-term freedom of recurrence and 
increase stricture complexity.",1b
