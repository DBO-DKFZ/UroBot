Counselling and outcomes assessment - Validated questionnaires
The Augmentation Phalloplasty Patient Selection and Satisfaction Inventory (APPSSI) questionnaire is a 5-item 
questionnaire proposed for the assessment and counselling about penile augmentation surgical treatment 
[1465]. The Beliefs about Penis Size (BAPS) is a 10-item questionnaire created for audit and outcome research 
to assess men’s beliefs about penile size [1464]. Both questionnaires have failed to correlate with penile size 
and lack of objective validation has restricted their use.",

with a short penis complaint.",4
Among stretched penile measurements STT may underestimate erect penile length.,2b
"Among stretched penile measurements BTT has a better correlation with erect penile length, 
especially in overweight and obese men.",2b
"Flaccid and erect state measurements to assess penile length may add useful information on penile 
size.",4
Penile girth assessment may add useful information on penile size and shape.,4
"The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire, The Cosmetic Procedure Screening Scale for Penile 
Dysmorphic Disorder, The Male Genital Self-Image Scale and the Index of Male Genital Image are self-
reported tools useful to screen patients at risk for psychopathology.",2b

sexual function and beliefs about penile size.",4
