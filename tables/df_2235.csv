"5.2.8.1.2	 Transrectal prostate biopsy
An updated meta-analysis of eleven RCTs including 2,237 men showed that use of a rectal povidone-iodine 
preparation before biopsy, in addition to antimicrobial prophylaxis, resulted in a significantly lower rate of 
infectious complications (RR: 95% CI: 0.47 [0.36–0.61]) [301, 308-310]. Single RCTs showed no evidence of 
benefit for perineal skin disinfection [311], but reported an advantage for rectal povidone-iodine preparation 
before biopsy compared to after biopsy [312].
A meta-analysis of four RCTs including 671 men evaluated the use of rectal preparation by enema 
before transrectal biopsy. No significant advantage was found regarding infectious complications (RR: 95% 
 
CI: 0.96 [0.64–1.54]) [301].
An updated meta-analysis of 28 RCTs with 4,027 patients found no evidence that use of peri-
prostatic injection of local anaesthesia resulted in more infectious complications than no injection (RR: 95% 
CI: 1.08 [0.79–1.48]) [300, 301, 313]. A meta-analysis of 9 RCTs including 2,230 patients found that extended 
biopsy templates showed comparable infectious complications to standard templates (RR: 95% CI: 0.80 
 
[0.53–1.22]) [301]. Additional meta-analyses found no difference in infectious complications regarding needle 
guide type (disposable vs. reusable), needle type (coaxial vs. non-coaxial), needle size (large vs. small), and 
number of injections for peri-prostatic nerve block (standard vs. extended) [301].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"When performing systematic biopsy only, at least 12 cores are recommended.",Strong
"Systematic transperineal biopsies are preferred over systematic transrectal biopsies for 
detection of clinically significant PCa.",Strong
"Where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown a suspicious lesion, MR-targeted 
biopsy can be obtained through cognitive guidance, US/MR fusion software or direct 
in-bore guidance.",Weak
