Summary of evidence,LE
"The treatment regimen for ABP is based on clinical experience and a number of uncontrolled clinical 
studies. For systemically ill patients with ABP, parenteral antibiotic therapy is preferable. After 
normalisation of infection parameters, oral therapy can be substituted and continued for a total of two 
to four weeks.",3
"The role of fluoroquinolones as first-line agents for antimicrobial therapy for CBP was confirmed in a 
systematic review, with no significant differences between levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and prulifloxacin 
in terms of microbiological eradication, clinical efficacy and adverse events.",1a
"Metronidazole 500 mg three times daily for fourteen days was found to be efficient for eradication in 
93.3% of patients with T. vaginalis CBP.",1b
"In patients with CBP caused by obligate intracellular pathogens, macrolides showed higher 
microbiological and clinical cure rates compared to fluoroquinolones.",1a
Clinicians should consider local drug-resistance patterns when choosing antibiotics.,3
