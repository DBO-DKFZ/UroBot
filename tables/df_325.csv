Evaluation of treatment
For patients with chronic primary visceral pain, a visit to the clinician is important because they can ask 
questions, talk about how the process is going and have some time with the caregiver who understands the 
nature of their pain. First evaluation should take place after about six weeks to see if the treatment has been 
successful or not. When necessary adaptations are made and a next evaluation is planned.",
