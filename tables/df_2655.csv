Venous thrombosis
Transplant renal vein thrombosis is an early complication (prevalence 0.5-4%) and one of the most important 
causes of graft loss during the first post-operative month [182]. The aetiology includes technical errors and/or 
difficulties during surgery [177] and the hypercoagulative state of the recipient [183, 184]. Colour-Doppler-flow-
ultrasonography shows absence of venous flow with an abnormal arterial signal (usually a plateau-like reversed 
diastolic flow). Furthermore, it is common to see an enlargement of the graft due to venous congestion [185]. 
Surgical exploration is usually recommended despite the fact that the majority of the cases will result in graft 
loss. In those cases where the venous thrombosis has not resulted in kidney loss at surgical exploration, 
a venotomy with surgical thrombectomy after clamping the iliac vein can be performed. Alternatively, an 
explantation and subsequent re-implantation can be considered [177]. Thrombolytic agents can also be used; 
however, their results have not been satisfactory [177, 186, 187].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Suspect transplant renal artery stenosis in case of refractory arterial hypertension and/or increasing 
serum creatinine without hydronephrosis/infection.",3
"The diagnosis for transplant renal artery stenosis is by US-colour-Doppler, showing a peak systolic 
velocity of > 200 cm/s in the graft renal artery.",2a
"Interventional radiology is the first-line treatment option for transplant renal artery stenosis; however, in 
patients considered unsuitable for radiological angioplasty surgical treatment may be considered.",3
