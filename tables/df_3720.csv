Cell-free tissue engineered grafts
These grafts are derived from cadaveric or animal sources (e.g., porcine small intestine submucosa [SIS], 
acellular bladder matrix, acellular dermal matrix), are completely cell-free and serve as a scaffold for host cell 
ingrowth [530]. The main advantage suggested for their use is the off-shelf availability [530].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Use buccal or lingual mucosa if a graft is needed and these grafts are available.,Weak
"Inform the patient about the potential complications of the different types of oral grafting 
(buccal versus lingual versus lower lip) when an oral graft is proposed.",Strong
"Use penile skin if buccal/lingual mucosa is not available, suitable, or accepted by the 
patient for reconstruction.",Weak
Do not use genital skin graft in case of lichen sclerosus.,Strong
