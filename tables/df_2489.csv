Summary of evidence,LE
"Hereditary kidney cancer is thought to account for 5–8% of all kidney cancer cases, though that 
number is likely an underestimate.",3
"In case of renal cancer, if patient’s age is 46 years or younger, and/or with bilateral or multifocal 
tumours and/or with a first- or second-degree relative with RCC and/or with a close blood relative 
with a known pathogenic variant and/or with specific histologic characteristics (see text), the risk of 
hereditary cancer is significantly higher.",3
Hereditary RCC detection has unique implications for decision-making and follow-up.,3
