Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of vesicoureteric reflux in 
childhood",
Summary of evidence,LE
"There is no evidence that correction of persistent low-grade reflux (grades I-III) without symptoms and 
normal kidneys offers a significant benefit.",3
"The traditional approach of initial medical treatment after diagnosis and shifting to interventional 
treatment in case of breakthrough infections and new scar formation needs to be challenged, because 
the treatment should be tailored to different risk groups.",4
"Surgical correction should be considered in patients with persistent high-grade reflux (grades IV/V). 
There is no consensus about the timing and type of surgical correction. The outcome of reimplantation  
is better than endoscopic correction for higher grades of reflux, whereas satisfactory results can be 
achieved by endoscopic injection for lower grades.",3
"The choice of management depends on the presence of renal scars, clinical course, grade of reflux, 
ipsilateral renal function, bilaterality, bladder function, associated anomalies of the urinary tract, 
age, compliance, and parental preference. Febrile UTI, high-grade reflux, bilaterality, and cortical 
abnormalities are considered to be risk factors for possible renal damage. The presence of LUTD is an 
additional risk factor for new scars.",4
