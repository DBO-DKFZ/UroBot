Venous thrombosis
Transplant renal vein thrombosis is an early complication (prevalence 0.5-4%) and one of the most important 
causes of graft loss during the first post-operative month [182]. The aetiology includes technical errors and/or 
difficulties during surgery [177] and the hypercoagulative state of the recipient [183, 184]. Colour-Doppler-flow-
ultrasonography shows absence of venous flow with an abnormal arterial signal (usually a plateau-like reversed 
diastolic flow). Furthermore, it is common to see an enlargement of the graft due to venous congestion [185]. 
Surgical exploration is usually recommended despite the fact that the majority of the cases will result in graft 
loss. In those cases where the venous thrombosis has not resulted in kidney loss at surgical exploration, 
a venotomy with surgical thrombectomy after clamping the iliac vein can be performed. Alternatively, an 
explantation and subsequent re-implantation can be considered [177]. Thrombolytic agents can also be used; 
however, their results have not been satisfactory [177, 186, 187].",

"The diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis depends on colour-Doppler-flow-ultrasonography followed by 
surgical exploration to assess the status of the graft.",2b

are the treatment options for renal vein thrombosis.",2b
