Summary of evidence,LE
The oncological outcome in terms of OS following PN equals that of RN in patients with c/p T1 RCC.,1b
"Retrospective studies suggest that oncological outcomes are similar following PN vs. RN in patients 
with larger (> 7 cm) RCC. Post-operative complication rates are higher in PN patients.",3b
"Ipsilateral adrenalectomy during RN or PN has no survival advantage in the absence of clinically 
evident adrenal involvement.",3
"In patients with localised disease without radiographic evidence of LN metastases, a survival 
advantage of LND in conjunction with RN is not demonstrated in RCTs.",2b
Retrospective studies suggest a clinical benefit associated with LND in high-risk patients.,2b
"In patients unfit for surgery with massive haematuria or flank pain, embolisation can be a beneficial 
palliative approach.",3
