Pre-operative fasting
Pre-operative fasting has been advocated for elective surgery to avoid the complications associated with 
pulmonary aspiration during induction of anaesthesia. New regimens include a 30-60 minute limitation for 
clear liquids [1477, 1478] without increased risk of pulmonary aspiration [1479]. Several studies have shown 
that fasting times in clinical practice often exceed the guidelines with average fasting times of 6-10 hours 
[1478-1480]. Compared to adults, children have a higher metabolic rate and low glycogen stores and impaired 
gluconeogenesis, which makes hypoglycaemia an important issue to consider, especially in children < 36 
months old [1478]. Therefore, it is important to prevent too long fasting times. Clear-liquid carbohydrate drinks 
have been proposed to reduce these fasting times [1481].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Children are not simply smaller physiological versions of adults. They have their own unique metabolic 
features, which must be considered during surgery.",2
"During the intra-operative period balanced isotonic electrolyte solutions can be used to maintain a 
normal extracellular fluid volume.",1
Following abdominal surgery ERAS protocols can be used to reduce recovery times and complications.,1
