Summary of evidence and recommendations for varicocele",
Summary of evidence,LE
"The presence of varicocele in some men is associated with progressive testicular damage from 
adolescence onwards and a consequent reduction in fertility.",2a
"Although the treatment of varicocele in adolescents may be effective, there is a significant risk of over-
treatment as the majority of boys with a varicocele will have no fertility problems later in life.",3
"Varicocele repair may be effective in men with abnormal semen parameters, a clinical varicocele and 
otherwise unexplained male factor infertility.",1a
"Although there are no prospective randomised studies evaluating this, meta-analyses have suggested 
that varicocele repair leads to sperm appearing in the ejaculate of men with non-obstructive 
azoospermia.",2
"Microscopic approach (inguinal/subinguinal) may have lower recurrence and complications rates than 
non-microscopic approaches (retroperitoneal and laparoscopic), although no RCTs are available yet.",2a
"Varicocele is associated with raised DNA fragmentation and intervention has been shown to reduce 
DNA fragmentation.",2a
