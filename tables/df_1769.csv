Table 4: Recommendations for management in paediatric stones,,,
"Stone size and 
localisation*","Primary treatment 
option","Alternative treatment 
options",Comment
"Infant microlithiasis 
(<3mm, any 
location)",Observation,"Intervention and/or 
medical treatment","Individualised decision according to size 
progression, symptoms and metabolic 
factors."
Staghorn stones,PCNL,Open/SWL,"Multiple sessions and accesses with 
PCNL may be needed. Combination  
with SWL may be useful."
Pelvis < 10 mm,SWL,RIRS/PCNL,
Pelvis 10-20 mm,SWL/PCNL/RIRS,,"Multiple sessions with SWL may be 
needed. PCNL and RIRS have a similar 
recommendation grade."
Pelvis > 20 mm,PCNL,SWL/RIRS,"Multiple sessions with SWL may be 
needed."
"Lower pole calyx < 
10mm","Observation or 
SWL",PCNL/RIRS,"Stone clearance after SWL is lower than 
other locations."
"Lower pole calyx > 
10mm",PCNL,RIRS/SWL,"Anatomical variations are important for 
complete clearance after SWL."
"Upper ureteric 
stones",SWL,URS,"Flexible scopes may be needed in case 
of retropulsion."
"Lower ureteric 
stones",URS,SWL,
Bladder stones,"Endoscopic 
(transurethral or 
percutaneous)",SWL/Open,"Open is easier and with less operative 
time with large stones."
Summary of evidence,LE,,
The incidence of stone disease in children is increasing.,2,,
"Contemporary surgical treatment is based on minimally invasive modalities. Open surgery is very 
rarely indicated.",2a,,
"The term ‘clinically insignificant residual fragments’ is not appropriate for children since most of them 
become symptomatic and require intervention.",2b,,
Majority of the kidney stones < 3 mm in infants resolve spontaneously.,3,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,
"Use plain abdominal X-ray and ultrasound as the primary imaging techniques for the 
diagnosis and follow-up of stones.",Strong,,
"Use low-dose non-contrast computed tomography in cases with a doubtful diagnosis, 
especially of ureteral stones or complex cases requiring surgery.",Strong,,
"Perform a metabolic evaluation in any child with urinary stone disease. Any kind of 
interventional treatment should be supported with medical treatment for the underlying 
metabolic abnormality, if detected.",Strong,,
"Limit open surgery under circumstances in which the child is very young with large stones, 
in association with congenital problems requiring surgical correction and/or with severe 
orthopaedic deformities that limit positioning for endoscopic procedures.",Strong,,
"Observe infant microlithiasis, unless symptoms occur or size increases significantly.",Strong,,
