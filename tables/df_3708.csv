"6.3.5.1.3.3.2	Prostatic strictures secondary to radiation/high energy sources
Radiotherapy and high-energy modalities (cryoablation, HIFU) might provoke prostatic necrosis, sloughing 
and obstruction [100]. Cases refractory to TUR and with good bladder capacity might be salvaged by 
prostatectomy taking into account the morbidity associated with salvage RP (rectal injury, VUAS, incontinence) 
[100, 423]. Mundy et al., treated nine patients with patency in six, (67%) and one (11%) needing an AUS for 
severe incontinence [410].",

"Perform bladder neck reconstruction with Y-V or T-plasty for treatment refractory bladder 
neck stenosis (BNS).",Weak
"Warn patients about de novo urinary incontinence after reconstruction for BNS or 
bulbomembranous urethral strictures with previous benign prostatic obstruction surgery as 
aetiology.",Strong
