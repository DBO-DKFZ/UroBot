Diode laser enucleation of the prostate
Mechanism of action: For prostate surgery, diode lasers with a wavelength of 940, 980, 1,318, and 1,470 nm 
(depending on the semiconductor used) are marketed for vaporisation and enucleation. Only a few have been 
evaluated in clinical trials [385].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer 80-W 532-nm Potassium-Titanyl-Phosphate (KTP) laser vaporisation of the prostate 
to men with moderate-to-severe LUTS with a prostate volume of 30-80 mL as an alternative 
to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).",Strong
