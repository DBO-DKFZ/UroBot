Anastomotic urethroplasty in men with penile urethral strictures
Historically, the use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been 
discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively [263, 284]. Nevertheless, it has been performed in 
selected patients with very short strictures (usually < 1 cm) with 80-93% patency rate, with satisfactory QoL 
and sexual function and without any case of chordee [285] and with results comparable to augmentation 
urethroplasty [286].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"For strictures not amenable to EPA, FGU provides an 88-91% patency rate at short to medium  
follow-up",1b
"Augmented anastomotic repair provides good (88-92%) patency rates for bulbar strictures with a 
nearly obliterative segment, despite deterioration with time.",3
