Male breast cancer
In vitro and in vivo studies have clearly documented that breast cancer growth is significantly influenced by 
testosterone and/or by its conversion to E2 through different mechanisms and pathways [143]. Accordingly, 
the use of SERMs still represents an important therapeutic option in the management of this cancer [143]. 
No information is available on the role of testosterone therapy in patients successfully treated for male breast 
cancer; therefore, treated and active male breast cancer should be recognised as absolute contraindications 
for testosterone therapy.",
