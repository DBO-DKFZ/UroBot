"5.3.5.2	
Intra-prostatic injections
Mechanism of action: Various substances have been injected directly into the prostate in order to improve 
LUTS including Botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A), fexapotide triflutate (NX-1207) and PRX302. The primary 
mechanism of action of BoNT-A is through the inhibition of neurotransmitter release from cholinergic neurons 
[525]. The mechanisms of action for the injectables NX-1207 and PRX302 are not completely understood, but 
experimental data suggest apoptosis-induced atrophy of the prostate with both drugs [525].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Validated specific symptom score questionnaires and voiding diaries assist in the screening for and 
categorisation of UI.",3
"Pad test can be used to quantify the presence and severity of UI, as well as a patient’s response to 
treatment.",3
"There is limited evidence that urodynamics and PVR affect treatment choice in men with 
uncomplicated UI.",3
