Surgical approaches for first, second, third and further transplants
Transplant (bench/back-table) preparation is a crucial step in the transplantation process. The kidney must 
be inspected whilst on a sterile ice slush, removing peri-nephric fat when possible to permit inspection of the 
quality of the organ and to exclude exophytic renal tumours. Biopsy of the kidney on the back-table may be 
performed to help in the multifactorial decision-making process regarding the quality and usage of the kidney 
for both single and/or dual transplantation. Suspicious parenchymal lesions also require biopsy. Techniques for 
intra-operative kidney biopsy are discussed in section 3.1.3.",
