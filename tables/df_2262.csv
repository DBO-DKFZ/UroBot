prior to further investigations.",Weak
"In asymptomatic men with a PSA level between 3–10 ng/mL and a normal DRE, use

Summary of evidence,LE
"A meta-analysis of eight studies including 1,596 patients showed significantly reduced 
infectious complications in patients undergoing transperineal biopsy as compared to 
transrectal biopsy.",1a
"A meta-analysis of eight non-RCTS reported comparable rates of post-biopsy infections in 
patients undergoing transperineal biopsy irrespective if antibiotic prophylaxis was given or not.",1a
"A meta-analysis of eleven RCTs including 2,036 men showed that use of a rectal povidone-
iodine preparation before transrectal biopsy, in addition to antimicrobial prophylaxis, resulted 
in a significantly lower rate of infectious complications.",1a
