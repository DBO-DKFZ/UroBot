Diagnostic accuracy
Clinical diagnosis and cystometric findings sometimes do not correlate [66, 67] and asymptomatic women 
may have abnormalities on urodynamic testing. The diagnostic accuracy of urethral pressure profilometry [68] 
and urethral retro-resistance pressure measurement in SUI is poor [29]. Valsalva leak point pressure did not 
reliably assess UI severity in a cohort of women selected for surgical treatment of SUI [69]. Urethral pressure 
reflectometry may have greater diagnostic accuracy but its clinical role remains unclear [70]. Ambulatory 
urodynamics may detect unexpected physiological variance from normal more often than conventional 
cystometry does, but the clinical relevance of this is also uncertain [71, 72].",
