"10.1.2.5	
Recommendations for the diagnosis of ischaemic priapism",
Summary of evidence,LE
Emergency intervention for ischaemic priapism is mandatory.,2b
"The aim of treatment is to facilitate painless penile detumescence, to prevent chronic fibrosis of the 
corpus cavernosum.",3
"Erectile function preservation is directly related to the duration of ischaemic priapism, age and pre-
operative erectile status.",2b
"Phenylephrine is the recommended drug due to its favourable safety profile in the cardiovascular 
system compared to other drugs. Phenylephrine is usually diluted in normal saline with a 
concentration of 100-500 μg/mL and given in 200 μg doses every three to five minutes directly into  
the corpus cavernosum. Maximum dosage is 1 mg within one hour. Patients at high cardiovascular 
risk should be given lower doses. Patient monitoring is highly recommended.",2b
"Gadolinium-enhanced MRI may be useful to diagnose smooth muscle necrosis in cases of delayed or 
refractory priapism.",3
"Shunt procedures are effective to resolve priapism and provide pain relief. No clear recommendation 
of the superiority of one type of shunt over another can be given. Distal shunts are less invasive and 
associated with lower rate of erectile dysfunction.",2b
"Peri- and post-operative anticoagulant prophylaxis (325 mg acetylsalicylic acid pre-operatively, 5,000 
IU heparin intra-operatively and 81 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel five days post-
operatively) may prevent priapism recurrence.",3
"Erectile dysfunction is almost inevitable in prolonged cases or ischaemic priapism. Early implantation 
of penile prosthesis is associated with lower infection rates and complications compared to late 
implantation.",2b
