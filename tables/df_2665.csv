Malignancy after renal transplantation
Cancer development after kidney transplant has become a major problem as it is one of the main causes of 
death in this population. Urological cancers, have an increased incidence after kidney transplantation partly 
due to the increasing age of recipients and their prolonged survival after transplantation.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Human leukocyte antigen matching is very important in kidney transplantation as transplant outcome 
correlates with the number of HLA mismatches. Matching should concentrate on HLA antigens, which 
impact outcome.",3
"In accordance with national and international recommendations adequate (e.g. CDC, virtual) cross-
match tests must be performed before each kidney and combined kidney/pancreas transplantation to 
avoid hyper-acute rejection.",3
