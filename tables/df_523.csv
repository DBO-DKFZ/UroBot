Table 7.1: Management of neobladder morbidity (30-64%) [392],,,
"CLAVIEN 
System",,"Morbidity
Management",
Grade I,"Any deviation from the normal
post-operative course without
the need for pharmacological
treatment or surgical, endoscopic 
and radiological interventions.
Allowed therapeutic regimens
are: drugs such as antiemetics,
antipyretics, analgesics,
diuretics and electrolytes and
physiotherapy.
This grade also includes wound
infections opened at the bedside.",Immediate complications:,
,,Post-operative ileus,"Nasogastric intubation (usually 
removed at day 1)
Chewing gum
Avoid fluid excess and 
hypovolemia (provoke 
splanchnic hypoperfusion)"
,,"Post-operative nausea 
and vomiting","Antiemetic agent  
(decrease opioids)
Nasogastric intubation"
,,Urinary infection,"Antibiotics, no ureteral catheter 
removal
Check the 3 drainages (ureters 
and neobladdder)"
,,"Ureteral catheter 
obstruction","Inject 5 cc saline in the 
ureteral catheter to resolve the 
obstruction
Increase volume infusion to 
increase diuresis"
,,"Intra-abdominal urine 
leakage (anastomosis 
leakage)","Check and reposition drainages, 
if needed"
,,Anaemia well tolerated,"Martial treatment  
(give iron supplement)"
,,Late complications:,
,,"Non compressive 
lymphocele",Watchful waiting
,,Mucus cork,"Catheterise and rinse the 
bladder"
,,Incontinence,"Urine analysis (infection), 
echography (post-void residual)
Physiotherapy"
,,Retention,"Drainage and self-
catheterisation education"
,,Ureteral reflux,No treatment if asymptomatic
Grade II,"Requiring pharmacological
treatment with drugs other
than those allowed for grade I
complications. Blood transfusions 
and total parenteral nutrition are 
also included.","Anaemia badly tolerated 
or if myocardial 
cardiopathy history",Transfusion1
,,Pulmonary embolism,Heparinotherapy2
,,Pyelonephritis,"Antibiotics and check kidney 
drainage
(nephrostomy if necessary)"
,,"Confusion or neurological 
disorder",Neuroleptics and avoid opioids
Grade III,"Requiring surgical, endoscopic or 
radiological intervention","Ureteral catheter 
accidentally dislodged",Reposition the ureteral catheter
,,"Anastomosis stenosis 
(7%)","Renal drainage (ureteral 
catheter or nephrostomy)"
III-a,"Intervention not under general 
anaesthesia",Compressive lymphocele,Transcutaneous drainage
III-b,"Intervention under general 
anaesthesia",Ileal anastomosis leakage,"Ileostomy, as soon as possible"
,,Evisceration,Surgery in emergency
,,Compressive lymphocele,Surgery (marsupialisation)
Grade IV,"Life-threatening complication 
(including central nervous 
system complications: brain 
haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, 
subarachnoid bleeding, but 
excluding transient ischaemic 
attacks) requiring intensive care/ 
intensive care unit management.",Neobladder rupture,"Nephrostomy and indwelling 
catheter/surgery for draining the 
neobladder"
,,Severe sepsis,"Antibiotics and check all the 
urinary drainages and CT scan 
in emergency"
IV-a,Single organ dysfunction,"Non-obstructive renal 
failure","Bicarbonate/aetiology treatment 
(including dialysis)"
IV-b,Multi-organ dysfunction,"Obstructive pyelonephritis 
and septicaemia","Treatment at intensive care unit, 
including urinary drainage and 
antibiotics"
Grade V,Death of a patient,,
Suffix ‘d’,"If the patient suffers from a complication at the time of discharge, the suffix “d” (for ‘disability’) 
is added to the respective grade of complication. This label indicates the need for a follow-up to 
fully evaluate the complication.",,
