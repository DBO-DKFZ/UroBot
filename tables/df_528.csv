Summary of evidence and guidelines for metastatic disease,
Summary of evidence,LE
"In a first-line setting, PS and the presence or absence of visceral metastases are independent 
prognostic factors for survival.",1b
"In a second-line setting, negative prognostic factors are: liver metastasis, PS > 1 and low haemoglobin 
(< 10 g/dL).",1b
"Cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy can achieve median survival of up to 14 months, with 
long-term DFS reported in ~15% of patients with nodal disease and good PS.",1b
Single-agent chemotherapy provides low response rates of usually short duration.,2a
"Carboplatin combination chemotherapy is less effective than cisplatin-based chemotherapy in terms 
of complete response and survival.",2a
"There is no defined standard therapy for platinum chemotherapy-unfit patients with advanced or 
metastatic UC.",2b
"Post-chemotherapy surgery after partial or complete response may contribute to long-term DFS in 
highly selected patients.",3
"Zoledronic acid and denosumab have been approved for supportive treatment in case of bone 
metastases of all cancer types including UC, as they reduce and delay skeletal related events.",1b
"PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has been approved for patients that have progressed during or after 
previous platinum-based chemotherapy based on the results of a phase III trial.",1b
"Enfortumab vedotin after prior platinum chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has 
demonstrated a significant survival benefit as compared to chemotherapy.",1b
"PD-1 inhibitor atezolizumab is approved for patients with advanced or metastatic UC unfit for 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy in case of high PD-L1 expression defined as tumour-infiltrating immune 
cells covering > 5% of the tumour area using the SP142 assay.",1b
"PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab is approved for patients with advanced or metastatic UC unfit for any 
platinum-based chemotherapy in case of high PD-L1 expression defined as CPS of > 10 using the 
Dako 22C33 platform (EMA; FDA approval independent of PD-L1 status).",1b
"The combination of chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab or atezolizumab and the combination of 
durvalumab and tremelimumab have not demonstrated OS survival benefit compared to platinum-
based chemotherapy alone.",1b
"Switch maintenance with the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab has demonstrated significant OS benefit in 
patients achieving at least stable disease on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.",1b
"Recommendations 
Strength rating",
First-line treatment for platinum-fit patients,
Use cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy with GC or HD-MVAC.,Strong
"In patients unfit for cisplatin but fit for carboplatin, use the combination of carboplatin and 
gemcitabine.",Strong
"In patients achieving stable disease, or better, after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, 
use maintenance treatment with PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab.",Strong
First-line treatment in patients unfit for platinum-based chemotherapy,
"Consider checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab or atezolizumab in case of high PD-L1 
Weak
expression (for definitions see text).",
Second-line treatment,
"Offer checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab to patients progressing during, or after, platinum-
Strong
based combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease.",
Further treatment after platinum- and immunotherapy,
"Offer antibody drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin as monotherapy to patients with 
advanced or metastatic UC pre-treated with platinum and immunotherapy.",Strong
"Offer treatment in clinical trials testing novel drugs (e.g. sacituzumab govitecan); or in case 
of patients with FGFR3 alterations, FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",Strong
"Evaluate for FGFR2/3 genetic alterations for the potential use of erdafitinib in patients 
with locally-advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have progressed following 
platinum-containing chemotherapy (including within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant 
platinum-containing chemotherapy).",Weak
