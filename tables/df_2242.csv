Treatment of intermediate-risk disease
When managed with non-curative intent, intermediate-risk PCa is associated with 10-year and 15-year PCSM 
rates of 13.0% and 19.6%, respectively [841]. These estimates are based on systematic biopsies and may be 
overestimated in the era of MRI-targeted biopsies.",
"Recommendations 
Strength rating",
Watchful Waiting,
"Manage patients with a life expectancy < 10 years by watchful waiting. 
Strong",
Active surveillance (AS),
"Manage patients with a life expectancy > 10 years and low-risk disease by AS.
Strong",
Selection of patients,
Patients with intraductal histology on biopsy should be excluded from AS.,Strong
"Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before a confirmatory biopsy if no MRI has been 
performed before the initial biopsy.",Strong
"Take both targeted biopsy (of any PI-RADS > 3 lesion) and systematic biopsy if a 
confirmatory biopsy is performed.",Strong
"If MRI is not available, per-protocol confirmatory prostate biopsies should be performed.",Weak
"If a patient has had upfront MRI followed by systematic and targeted biopsies there is no 
need for confirmatory biopsies.",Weak
Follow-up of patients,
"Repeat biopsies should be performed at least once every 3 years for 10 years. 
Weak",
"In case of prostate-specific antigen progression or change in digital-rectal examination or 
Strong
MRI findings, do not progress to active treatment without a repeat biopsy.",
