T - Primary Tumour (stage based on digital rectal examination [DRE] only)
"TX 
Primary tumour cannot be assessed
T0 
No evidence of primary tumour
T1 
Clinically inapparent tumour that is not palpable
T1a
Tumour incidental histological finding in 5% or less of tissue resected
T1b
Tumour incidental histological finding in more than 5% of tissue resected
T1c
Tumour identified by needle biopsy (e.g. because of elevated prostate-specific antigen [PSA])
T2 
Tumour that is palpable and confined within the prostate
T2a
Tumour involves one half of one lobe or less
T2b
Tumour involves more than half of one lobe, but not both lobes
T2c
Tumour involves both lobes
T3 
Tumour extends palpably through the prostatic capsule
T3a
Extracapsular extension (unilateral or bilateral)
T3b
Tumour invades seminal vesicle(s)
T4 
Tumour is fixed or invades adjacent structures other than seminal vesicles: external sphincter, rectum, 
levator muscles, and/or pelvic wall"
N - Regional (pelvic) Lymph Nodes1
"NX 
Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
N0
