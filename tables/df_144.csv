Summary of evidence and guidelines for the surgical management of cN3 disease,
"About half of the patients with advanced (cN2–cN3) penile cancer respond to combination 
chemotherapy. Responders that subsequently undergo consolidative inguinal/PLND have an OS 
chance of about 50% at 5 years.",2a
"Inguinal LND in cN3 patients often requires resection of overlying skin to effectively remove a fixed 
bulky nodal mass.",4
"The available literature includes virtually no cN3 patients to assess the efficacy or safety of minimally-
invasive ILND.",4
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using a cisplatin- and taxane-based combination 
to chemotherapy-fit patients with pelvic lymph node involvement or those with extensive 
inguinal involvement (cN3), in preference to up front surgery. (see Section 6.4.1).",Weak
Offer surgery to patients responding to NAC in whom resection is feasible.,Strong
"Offer surgery to patients who have not progressed during NAC, but resection is feasible.
