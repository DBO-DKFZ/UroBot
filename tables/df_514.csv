Summary of evidence and guidelines for staging in muscle-invasive bladder cancer,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Imaging as part of staging in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) provides information about 
prognosis and assists in selection of the most appropriate treatment.",2b
"The diagnosis of upper tract UC depends on CT urography and, if needed, ureteroscopy.",2b
"In local staging, MRI is superior to CT in terms of differentiating T1 from T2 disease.",2b
Bone scintigraphy has limited value in the staging of invasive BC.,3
FDG-PET/CT can provide additional information to guide treatment.,2b
Recommendations,Strength rating
"In patients with confirmed muscle-invasive bladder cancer, use computed tomography (CT) 
of the chest, abdomen and pelvis for staging, including some form of CT urography with 
designated phases for optimal urothelial evaluation.",Strong
"Use CT urography, unless it is contraindicated for reasons related to contrast adminstration 
or radiation dose; in that case use magnetic resonance imaging.",Strong
