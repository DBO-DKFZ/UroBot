Ureteral stenosis
Ureteral stenosis is a common complication in recipients, with an incidence of 0.6-10.5% [207]. Early 
stenosis (within three months of surgery) is usually caused by surgical technique or compromised ureteral 
blood supply during surgery. Late stenosis (after > six months) is provoked by infection, fibrosis, progressive 
vascular disease and/or rejection [202, 208]. Clinically significant ureteral stricture should be considered when 
persistent hydronephrosis on US occurs in association with impaired renal function. The first approach in the 
management of stricture is the placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy tube with an antegrade pyelogram 
[207]. The following treatment options depend mainly on the timing, recoverable kidney function, anatomy 
of the stricture, patient body habitus/comorbidities, and surgeon preference. Strictures < 3 cm in length may 
be treated endoscopically either with percutaneous balloon dilation or antegrade flexible ureteroscopy and 
holmium laser incision. In this scenario the success rate approaches 50%; although, maximum success is 
obtained for strictures < 1 cm [209-211]. In case of a recurrence after a primary endourological approach 
and/or stricture > 3 cm in length, surgical reconstruction should be performed [208] including direct ureteral 
re-implantation, pyelo-vesical re-implantation (with or without psoas hitch and/or Boari Flap) or in cases with a 
normal native ureter, uretero-ureterostomy [212, 213]. Long-term graft and patient survival are not significantly 
affected [214].",
