Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic evaluation of LOH",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Check for concomitant diseases, drugs and substances that can interfere with testosterone 
production/action.",Strong
"Measure total testosterone in the morning (07.00 and 11.00 hours) and in the fasting state, 
with a reliable laboratory assay.",Strong
"Repeat total testosterone on at least two separate occasions when < 12 nmol/L and before 
starting testosterone therapy.",Strong
"Use 12 nmol/L total testosterone (3.5 ng/mL) as a reliable threshold to diagnose late onset 
hypogonadism (LOH).",Strong
Consider sex hormone-binding globulin and free-testosterone calculation when indicated.,Strong
"Calculated free-testosterone of < 225 pmol/L has been suggested as a possible cut-off to 
diagnose LOH.",Weak
"Analyse luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone serum levels to differentiate 
between primary and secondary hypogonadism.",Strong
"Consider prolactin (PRL) measurement if low sexual desire (or other suggestive signs/
symptoms) and low or low-normal testosterone is present.",Strong
"Perform pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in secondary hypogonadism, with 
elevated PRL or symptoms specific of a pituitary mass and/or presence of other anterior 
pituitary hormone deficiency.",Strong
Perform pituitary MRI in secondary severe hypogonadism (total testosterone < 6 nmol/L).,Weak
