rUTIs",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Diagnose recurrent UTI by urine culture.,Strong
"Do not perform an extensive routine workup (e.g., cystoscopy, full abdominal ultrasound) in 
women younger than 40 years of age with recurrent UTI and no risk factors.",Weak
"Advise pre-menopausal women regarding increased fluid intake as it might reduce the risk 
of recurrent UTI.",Weak
Use vaginal oestrogen replacement in post-menopausal women to prevent recurrent UTI.,Strong
Use immunoactive prophylaxis to reduce recurrent UTI in all age groups.,Strong
"Advise patients on the use of local or oral probiotic containing strains of proven efficacy for 
vaginal flora regeneration to prevent UTIs.",Weak

however, patients should be informed that the quality of evidence underpinning this is low 
with contradictory findings.",Weak
"Use D-mannose to reduce recurrent UTI episodes, but patients should be informed of the 
overall weak and contradictory evidence of its effectiveness.",Weak

abnormalities of the urinary tract.",Strong
"Use endovesical instillations of hyaluronic acid or a combination of hyaluronic acid and 
chondroitin sulphate to prevent recurrent UTIs in patients where less invasive preventive 
approaches have been unsuccessful. Patients should be informed that further studies are 
needed to confirm the results of initial trials.",Weak
