Disease management
Antimicrobial therapy is recommended because clinical success is significantly more likely in women treated 
with antimicrobials compared with placebo [108]. In female patients with mild to moderate symptoms, 
symptomatic therapy (e.g. Ibuprofen), as an alternative to antimicrobial treatment, may be considered in 
consultation with individual patients [109-112]. The choice of antimicrobial therapy should be guided by [99]:
•	
spectrum and susceptibility patterns of the aetiological pathogens;
•	
efficacy for the particular indication in clinical studies;
•	
tolerability and adverse reactions;
•	
adverse ecological effects;
•	
costs;
•	
availability.",
