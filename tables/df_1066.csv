"4.2.4.3.2.1	Open- and laparoscopic colposuspension surgery
Open Burch colposuspension was previously considered the most appropriate surgical intervention for 
SUI, and was used as the comparator in RCTs of newer, less-invasive surgical techniques. These include 
laparoscopic techniques, which have enabled colposuspension to be performed with a minimally-invasive 
approach.",
