Summary of evidence and guidelines for life-prolonging treatments of castrate-resistant,
Summary of evidence,LE
"First-line treatment for mCRPC will be influenced by which treatments were used when metastatic 
cancer was first discovered.",4
"No clear-cut recommendation can be made for the most effective drug for first-line CRPC treatment 
(i.e., hormone therapy, chemotherapy or radium-223) as no validated predictive factors exist.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Ensure that testosterone levels are confirmed to be < 50 ng/dL before diagnosing castrate-
resistant PCa (CRPC).",Strong
"Counsel, manage and treat patients with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) in a multidisciplinary 
team.",Strong
Treat patients with mCRPC with life-prolonging agents.,Strong
"Offer mCRPC patients somatic and/or germline molecular testing as well as testing for 
mismatch repair deficiencies or microsatellite instability.",Strong
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Base the choice of treatment on the performance status (PS), symptoms, co-morbidities, 
location and extent of disease, genomic profile, patient preference, and on previous 
treatment for hormone-sensitive metastatic PCa (mHSPC) (alphabetical order: abiraterone, 
cabazitaxel, docetaxel, enzalutamide, olaparib, radium-223, sipuleucel-T).",Strong
"Offer patients with mCRPC who are candidates for cytotoxic therapy and are chemotherapy 
naiive docetaxel with 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.",Strong
"Offer patients with mCRPC and progression following docetaxel chemotherapy further 
life-prolonging treatment options, which include abiraterone, cabazitaxel, enzalutamide, 
radium-223 and olaparib in case of DNA homologous recombination repair (HRR) alterations.",Strong
"Base further treatment decisions of mCRPC on PS, previous treatments, symptoms, 
co-morbidities, genomic profile, extent of disease and patient preference.",Strong
"Offer abiraterone or enzalutamide to patients previously treated with one or two lines of 
chemotherapy.",Strong
Avoid sequencing of androgen receptor targeted agents.,Weak
Offer chemotherapy to patients previously treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide.,Strong
Offer cabazitaxel to patients previously treated with docetaxel.,Strong
"Offer cabazitaxel to patients previously treated with docetaxel and progressing within 12 
months of treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide.",Strong
Novel agents,
"Offer poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors to pre-treated mCRPC patients with 
relevant DNA repair gene mutations.",Strong
"Offer 177Lu-PSMA-617 to pre-treated mCRPC patients with one or more metastatic lesions, 
highly expressing PSMA (exceeding the uptake in the liver) on the diagnostic radiolabelled 
PSMA PET/CT scan.",Strong
