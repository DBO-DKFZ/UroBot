"6.3.2.3.3	 Risk factors
There is a lot effort in identifying risk factors affecting the success rate of urethroplasties.
The evidence is not clear about age, obesity, aetiology or prior radiation or prior surgery. The only clear risk 
factors in multivariate analysis are the length and the site of the stricture, success rates are better in shorter or 
bulbar strictures and worse in longer or penile strictures [317, 344-346]. Patient should be informed about the 
higher risk in longer and penile strictures.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer panurethral urethroplasties in specialised centres because different techniques and 
materials might be needed.",Weak
"Combine techniques to treat panurethral strictures if one technique is not able to treat the 
whole extent of the stricture.",Weak
