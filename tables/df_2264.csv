6.2.1.3 Summary of evidence and guidelines for follow-up during active surveillance,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Serial magnetic resonance imaging can improve the detection of aggressive cancers during 
follow-up.",3
A progression on MRI mandates a repeat biopsy before a change in treatment strategy.,
A stationary MRI does not make repeat biopsy superfluous.,
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Base follow-up during active surveillance (AS) on a strict protocol including digital 
rectal examination (at least once yearly), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (at least 
once every 6 months) and repeated biopsy every 2 to 3 years.",Strong
"Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and repeat biopsy if PSA is rising (PSA-
doubling time < 3 years).",Strong
"Re-classify patients with low-volume ISUP grade group 2 disease included in 
AS protocols, if repeat non-MRI-based systematic biopsies performed during 
monitoring reveal > 3 positive cores or maximum CI > 50%/core of ISUP 2 disease.",Weak
"Base change in treatment on biopsy progression, not on progression on MRI and/
or PSA.",Weak
"Patients with a PI-RADS 1-2 findings on MRI and a low PSA density (< 0.15) may be 
excepted from repeat biopsy.",Weak
