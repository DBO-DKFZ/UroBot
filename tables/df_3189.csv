Counselling and outcomes assessment - Validated questionnaires
The Augmentation Phalloplasty Patient Selection and Satisfaction Inventory (APPSSI) questionnaire is a 5-item 
questionnaire proposed for the assessment and counselling about penile augmentation surgical treatment 
[1465]. The Beliefs about Penis Size (BAPS) is a 10-item questionnaire created for audit and outcome research 
to assess men’s beliefs about penile size [1464]. Both questionnaires have failed to correlate with penile size 
and lack of objective validation has restricted their use.",
