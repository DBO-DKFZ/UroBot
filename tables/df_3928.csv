Contraindications of extracorporeal SWL
There are several contraindications to the use of extracorporeal SWL, including:
•	
pregnancy, due to the potential effects on the foetus [353];
•	
bleeding disorders, which should be compensated for at least 24 hours before and 48 hours after 
treatment [354];
•	
uncontrolled UTIs;
•	
severe skeletal malformations and severe obesity, which prevent targeting of the stone;
•	
arterial aneurysm in the vicinity of the stone [355];
•	
anatomical obstruction distal to the stone.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Active surveillance is indicated in patients at high risk for thrombotic complications in the presence of 
an asymptomatic calyceal stone.",4
"The temporary discontinuation, or bridging of antithrombotic therapy in high-risk patients, should be 
discussed with the internist.",3
"Retrograde (flexible) URS stone removal is associated with less morbidity in patients when antithrombotic 
therapy cannot be discontinued.",2a
