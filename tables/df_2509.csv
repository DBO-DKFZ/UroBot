Papillary metastatic RCC
The most common non-cc subtype is papillary RCC (pRCC). There are small single-arm trials for sunitinib and 
everolimus [550-554]. Both these agents have been widely given in pRCC, but more recent data suggests 
cabozantinib and other combinations may be preferable [555, 556].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Both mTOR inhibitors and VEGF-targeted therapies have limited activity in non-cc-mRCC. There 
is a non-significant trend for improved oncological outcomes for sunitinib over everolimus and for 
cabozantinib over sunitinib.",2a
"In non-cc-mRCC, sunitinib improved PFS over everolimus in a systematic review of phase II trials and 
subgroups of patients.",1a
