"4.8.2	
Interpretation
Infection stones contain the following minerals: struvite and/or carbonate apatite and/or ammonium urate. 
Urine culture typically provides evidence for urease-producing bacteria, which increase ammonia ions and 
develop alkaline urine (Table 4.10). Carbonate apatite starts to crystallise at a urine pH level of 6.8. Struvite only 
precipitates at pH > 7.2 [707, 708]. A mixed struvite stones, i.e. containing a high percentage of calcium oxalate 
and carbonate apatite, suggests the over infection of a “metabolic” calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate 
stone [706]. Proteus mirabilis accounts for more than half of all urease-positive UTIs [709, 710].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Removing the stone material as completely as possible with surgery can reduce ongoing infection.,3
Antibiotics are beneficial after complete stone removal.,3
"Ammonium chloride, 1 g, two or three times daily, can ensure urinary acidification to prevent recurrent 
infection.",3
"Methionine, 200-500 mg, one to three times daily, can be used as an alternative to ammonium 
chloride, to ensure urinary acidification.",3
Treatment of underlying metabolic abnormalities reduces recurrence of mixed struvite stones.,3
Urease inhibitors in case of severe infection are occasionally used (if licensed).,1b
