Summary of evidence,LE,
"Children are not simply smaller physiological versions of adults. They have their own unique metabolic 
features, which must be considered during surgery.",2,
"During the intra-operative period balanced isotonic electrolyte solutions can be used to maintain a 
normal extracellular fluid volume.",1,
Following abdominal surgery ERAS protocols can be used to reduce recovery times and complications.,1,
Recommendations,Strength rating,
"Ensure shorter pre-operative fasting periods for elective surgeries (up to one hour for clear 
liquids).",Strong,
"Use enhanced recovery after surgery protocols for abdominal surgery in children with 
normal bowel movement.",Strong,
"Use isotonic solutions in hospitalised children because they are at high risk of developing 
hyponatraemia.",Strong,
"Assess the baseline and daily levels of serum electrolytes, glucose, urea and/or creatinine 
in every child who receives intravenous fluids, especially in intestinal surgery (e.g. ileal 
augmentation), regardless of the type of solution chosen since there is an increased risk of 
electrolyte abnormalities in children undergoing such surgery.",Strong,
Start early oral fluid intake in all patients scheduled for minor surgical procedures.,Strong,
