Summary of evidence and recommendations for the treatment of complicated UTIs",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Patients with a UTI with systemic symptoms requiring hospitalisation should be initially treated with an 
intravenous antimicrobial regimen chosen based on local resistance data and previous urine culture 
results from the patient, if available. The regimen should be tailored on the basis of susceptibility results.",1b
"If the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance is thought to be < 10% and the patient has 
contraindications for third generation cephalosporins or an aminoglycoside, ciprofloxacin can be 
prescribed as an empirical treatment in women with complicated pyelonephritis.",2
"In the event of hypersensitivity to penicillin a cephalosporins can still be prescribed, unless the patient 
has had systemic anaphylaxis in the past.",2
"In patients with a cUTI with systemic symptoms, empirical treatment should cover ESBL if there is 
an increased likelihood of ESBL infection based on prevalence in the community, earlier collected 
cultures and prior antimicrobial exposure of the patient.",2
"Intravenous levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for five days, is non-inferior to a seven to fourteen day 
regimen of levofloxacin 500 mg once daily starting intravenously and switched to an oral regimen 
(based on mitigation of clinical symptoms).",2
