Summary of evidence,LE
"Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy for high-risk patients (pT3, 4 and/or or N+ M0) without 
neoadjuvant treatment can be associated with improvement in DFS and OS but trials are 
underpowered to adequately answer this question.",2a
"To date, studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the adjuvant setting in patients with high-risk  
MIBC who have or have not received NAC have demonstrated conflicting results with the  
CheckMate 274 study demonstrating an improvement in DFS with adjuvant nivolumab and the  
IMvigor 010 study failing to show an improvement in DFS with adjuvant atezolizumab.",1b
"Circulating tumour DNA holds promise as both a prognostic and predictive biomarker to guide the use 
of adjuvant IO for UC in patients who are at a high risk of recurrence and positive for ctDNA treated 
with adjuvant atezolizumab demonstrating improved outcomes compared with observation.",2b
