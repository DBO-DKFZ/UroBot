Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,
"Deferred CN with pre-surgical sunitinib in intermediate-risk patients with cc-mRCC shows a survival 
benefit in secondary endpoint analyses and selects out patients with inherent resistance to systemic 
therapy.",2b,,,,,
"Sunitinib alone is non-inferior compared to immediate CN followed by sunitinib in patients with 
MSKCC intermediate and poor risk who require systemic therapy with VEGFR-TKI.",1a,,,,,
"Cytoreductive nephrectomy in patients with simultaneous complete resection of a single metastasis or 
oligometastases may improve survival and delay systemic therapy.",3,,,,,
Patients with MSKCC or IMDC poor risk do not benefit from CN.,1a,,,,,
"Patients with their primary tumour in place treated with IO-based combination therapy have better 
PFS and OS in exploratory subgroup analyses compared to treatment with sunitinib.",2b,,,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,
Do not perform cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) in MSKCC poor-risk patients.,Strong,,,,,
"Do not perform immediate CN in intermediate-risk patients who have an asymptomatic 
synchronous primary tumour and require systemic therapy.",Weak,,,,,
"Start systemic therapy without CN in intermediate-risk patients who have an asymptomatic 
synchronous primary tumour and require systemic therapy.",Weak,,,,,
Discuss delayed CN with patients who derive clinical benefit from systemic therapy.,Weak,,,,,
"Perform immediate CN in patients with a good performance status who do not require 
systemic therapy.",Weak,,,,,
"Perform immediate CN in patients with oligometastases when complete local treatment of 
the metastases can be achieved.",Weak,,,,,
