4.5.7.10  Summary of evidence and recommendations for surgical management of bladder outlet obstruction,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Intrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin results in the improvement of symptoms and urodynamic 
parameters.",2
"Sacral nerve stimulation results in spontaneous voiding and a reduction in CISC rate in the majority of 
female BOO patients in idiopathic urinary retention.",3
"More serious adverse events and surgical revisions were associated with the one-stage neuromodulator 
implantation procedure.",3
Repair of POP improved PVR and voiding symptoms.,3
"Urethral dilatation in women with BOO results in significant improvement in OAB symptoms, but 
improvements in urodynamic parameters of voiding are inconsistent.",1b
"Programmed intermittent urethral dilatation results in better outcomes compared with on-demand 
dilatation.",3
"Effects of urethral dilation are poorly sustained, requiring repeat intervention in the long term.",3
"Internal urethrotomy followed by regular dilatations resulted in significant improvement in symptoms 
and urodynamic parameters in women with BOO.",3
"Bladder neck incision in females with BOO results in improvements in symptoms and urodynamic 
parameters.",3
"Complications of bladder neck incision are not common, but include VVF, SUI, and urethral stricture.",3
"Urethroplasty using grafts or flaps in women with BOO due to urethral stricture have good success 
rates with significant improvements of symptoms, QoL scores and urodynamic parameters compared 
to baseline.",3
Urethroplasty results in better QoL and Qmax compared to urethral dilatation.,2
Long-term results showed significant stricture recurrence rate after urethroplasty.,3
"Urethrolysis performed on women with voiding problems after anti-UI surgery resulted in 
improvements in symptoms, QoL and urodynamic parameters post-operatively.",3
Delayed urethrolysis was associated with persistent post-operative bladder symptoms.,3
"Sling revision in women who presented with urinary retention or voiding problems and significant 
PVRs after sling surgery for UI resulted in improvements in symptoms and urodynamic parameters, 
resumption of voiding and reductions in PVRs.",3
Sling revision is associated with the risk of recurrent SUI.,3
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer intra-sphincteric injection of botulinum toxin to women with functional bladder outlet 
obstruction (BOO).",Weak
Offer sacral neuromodulation to women with functional BOO.,Weak
"Advise women with voiding symptoms associated with pelvic organ prolapse that 
symptoms may improve after surgery.",Weak
"Offer urethral dilatation to women with urethral stenosis causing BOO but advise on the 
likely need for repeated intervention.",Weak
"Offer internal urethrotomy with postoperative urethral self-dilatation to women with BOO 
due to urethral stricture disease but advise on its limited long-term improvement and the 
risk of postoperative urinary incontinence (UI).",Weak
"Do not offer urethral dilatation or urethrotomy as a treatment for BOO to women who have 
previously undergone mid-urethral synthetic tape insertion due to the theoretical risk of 
causing urethral mesh extrusion.",Weak
"Inform women of limited long-term improvement (only in terms of post-void residual volume 
and quality of life) after internal urethrotomy.",Weak
"Offer bladder neck incision to women with BOO secondary to primary bladder neck 
obstruction.",Weak
"Advise women who undergo bladder neck incision on the small risk of developing stress 
urinary incontinence (SUI), vesico-vaginal fistula or urethral stricture postoperatively.",Strong
"Offer urethroplasty to women with BOO due to recurrent urethral stricture after failed 
primary treatment.",Weak
"Caution women on the possible recurrence of strictures on long-term follow-up after 
urethroplasty.",Weak
Offer urethrolysis to women who have voiding difficulties after anti-UI surgery.,Weak
"Offer sling revision (release, incision, partial excision, or excision) to women who develop 
urinary retention or significant voiding difficulty after tape surgery for UI.",Strong
"Caution women about the risk for recurrent SUI and the need for a repeat/concurrent anti-UI 
surgery after sling revision.",Strong
