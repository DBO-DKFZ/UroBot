Summary of evidence,LE
Cystoscopy is necessary for the diagnosis of bladder cancer.,1
Urinary cytology has high sensitivity in high-grade tumours including carcinoma in situ.,2b
"In men, prostatic urethral biopsy includes resection from the bladder neck to the verumontanum 
(between the 5 and 7 o’clock position) using a resection loop. In case any abnormal-looking areas in 
the prostatic urethra are present at this time, these need to be biopsied as well.",2b
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Describe all macroscopic features of the tumour (site, size, number and appearance) and 
mucosal abnormalities during cystoscopy. Use a bladder diagram.",Strong
"Take a biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder neck tumour, when bladder 
carcinoma in situ is present or suspected, when there is positive cytology without evidence 
of tumour in the bladder, or when abnormalities of the prostatic urethra are visible.",Strong
"In men with a negative prostatic urethral biopsy undergoing subsequent orthotopic 
neobladder construction, an intra-operative frozen section can be omitted.",Strong
"In men with a prior positive transurethral prostatic biopsy, subsequent orthotopic 
neobladder construction should not be denied a priori, unless an intra-operative frozen 
section of the distal urethral stump reveals malignancy at the level of urethral dissection.",Strong
"In women undergoing subsequent orthotopic neobladder construction, obtain procedural 
information (including histological evaluation) of the bladder neck and urethral margin, either 
prior to, or at the time of cystectomy.",Strong
"In the pathology report, specify the grade, depth of tumour invasion, and whether the 
lamina propria and muscle tissue are present in the specimen.",Strong
