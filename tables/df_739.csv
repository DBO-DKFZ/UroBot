Summary of evidence,LE
"The EAU NMIBC 2021 scoring model and risk tables predict the short- and long-term risks of disease 
progression in individual patients with primary NMIBC using either the WHO 1973 or the WHO 2022 
classification system (see Section 6.1.2.1).",2b
"The 2006 EORTC scoring model and risk tables predict the short- and long-term risks of disease 
recurrence and progression in individual patients with NMIBC using the WHO 1973 classification 
system (see Section 6.1.1.1).",1b
"Patients with Ta G1/G2 tumours receiving chemotherapy have been further stratified into 3 risk groups 
for recurrence, taking into account the history of recurrences, history of intravesical treatment, tumour 
grade (WHO 1973), number of tumours and adjuvant chemotherapy (see Section 6.1.1.2).",2b
"In patients treated with 5 to 6 months of BCG, the CUETO scoring model predicts the short- and  
long-term risks of disease recurrence and progression using the WHO 1973 classification system  
(see Section 6.1.1.3).",1b
"In patients receiving at least 1 year of BCG maintenance; prior recurrence rate and number of tumours 
are the most important prognostic factors for disease recurrence. Stage and grade are the most 
important prognostic factors for disease progression and disease-specific survival; patient age and 
grade (WHO 1973) are the most important prognostic factors for OS (see Section 6.1.1.4).",1b
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Stratify patients into 4 risk groups to predict progression, according to Table 6.1. A patient’s 
risk group can be determined using the 2021 EAU risk group calculator available at  
www.nmibc.net.",Strong
"For information about the risk of disease progression in a patient with primary TaT1 
tumours, not treated with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), use the data from Table 6.2.",Strong
"Use the 2006 EORTC scoring model to predict the risk of tumour recurrence in individual 
patients not treated with BCG.",Strong
"Use the 2016 EORTC scoring model or the CUETO risk scoring model to predict the risk  
of tumour recurrence in individual patients treated with BCG intravesical immunotherapy 
(the 2016 EORTC model is calculated for 1 to 3 years of maintenance, the CUETO model  
for 5 to 6 months).",Strong
