Summary of evidence,LE
"The outcome of clinical UTI was reported in four out of eleven RCTs with no benefit found for antibiotic 
prophylaxis vs. placebo in patients following filling and voiding cystometry.",1b
"A meta-analysis of five trials of moderate quality showed a benefit for using antibiotic prophylaxis for 
the reduction of symptomatic UTI in patients undergoing cystoscopy. However, this benefit was not 
seen if only the two trials with low risk of bias were used in the meta-analysis.",1a
"Two meta-analyses found no benefit for antibiotic prophylaxis following ESWL in terms of reducing the 
rate of post-procedural fever and bacteriuria or trial-defined infection in patients without bacteriuria.",1a
"Two meta-analyses found no evidence of benefit for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to ureteroscopy in 
reducing the rate of clinical UTI; however, the rate of bacteriuria was reduced.",1a
"A meta-analysis of five RCTs demonstrated a moderate level of evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis was 
associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of post-procedural UTI following PNL.",1a
"Two RCTs concluded that a single dose of a suitable agent was adequate for prophylaxis against 
clinical infection after PNL.",1b
"A systematic review of 39 RCTs concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the rate of infectious 
complications in men undergoing TURP.",1b
"A systematic review of two RCTs found no benefit for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing 
TURB.",1b
"A meta-analysis of eight studies including 1,596 patients showed significantly reduced infectious 
complications in patients undergoing transperineal biopsy as compared to transrectal biopsy.",1a
"A meta-analysis of eight non-RCTS reported comparable rates of post-biopsy infections in patients 
undergoing transperineal biopsy irrespective if antibiotic prophylaxis was given or not.",1a
"A meta-analysis of eleven RCTs including 2,036 men showed that use of a rectal povidone-iodine 
preparation before transrectal biopsy, in addition to antimicrobial prophylaxis, resulted in a significantly 
lower rate of infectious complications.",1a
"A meta-analysis on eleven studies with 1,753 patients showed significantly reduced infections after 
transrectal biopsy when using antimicrobial prophylaxis as compared to placebo/control.",1a
