Non-invasive tests in diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction in men with LUTS
4.13.1	
Prostatic configuration/intravesical prostatic protrusion
Prostatic configuration can be evaluated with TRUS, using the concept of the presumed circle area ratio 
(PCAR) [108]. The PCAR evaluates how closely the transverse US image of the prostate approaches a circular 
shape. The ratio tends toward one as the prostate becomes more circular. The sensitivity of PCAR was 77% for 
diagnosing BPO when PCAR was > 0.8, with 75% specificity [108].
Ultrasound measurement of intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) assesses the distance between 
the tip of the prostate median lobe and bladder neck in the midsagittal plane, using a suprapubically positioned 
US scanner, with a bladder volume of 150-250 mL; grade I protrusion is 0-4.9 mm, grade II is 5-10 mm and 
grade III is > 10 mm.
Intravesical prostatic protrusion correlates well with BPO (presence and severity) on urodynamic 
testing, with a PPV of 94% and a NPV of 79% [109]. Intravesical prostatic protrusion may also correlate with 
prostate volume, DO, bladder compliance, detrusor pressure at maximum urinary flow, BOO index and PVR, 
and negatively correlates with Qmax [110]. Furthermore, IPP also appears to successfully predict the outcome 
of a trial without catheter after AUR [111, 112]. However, no information with regards to intra- or inter-observer 
variability and learning curve is yet available. Therefore, whilst IPP may be a feasible option to infer BPO in men 
with LUTS, the role of IPP as a non-invasive alternative to PFS in the assessment of male LUTS remains under 
evaluation.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Watchful waiting is usually a safe alternative for men who are less bothered by urinary difficulty or 
who wish to delay treatment. The treatment failure rate over a period of five years was 21%; 79% of 
patients were clinically stable.",1b
"An additional study reported 81% of patients were clinically stable on WW after a mean follow-up of 
seventeen months.",2
