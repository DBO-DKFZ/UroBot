Steroids
Steroids have a large number of side effects [242-244, 295], especially with long-term use. Most practitioners 
still consider steroids (either prednisolone or methylprednisolone) to be a fundamental adjunct to primary 
immunosuppression, even though successful steroid withdrawal has been achieved in the vast majority of 
patients in many prospective, randomised trials [242, 244, 245, 295, 300, 301]. The risk of steroid withdrawal 
depends on the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medication, immunological risk, ethnicity, and 
time after transplantation. Although the risk of rejection diminishes over time, potential benefits may be less 
prominent after a prolonged steroid treatment period [242-245, 295]. Recent studies suggest similar efficacy 
but less diabetes after early steroid withdrawal or steroid minimisation in low-risk patients treated with 
tacrolimus, MPA and induction (either basiliximab or ATG) [302, 303].",
