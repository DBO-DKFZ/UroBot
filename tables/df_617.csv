Table 1: Epidemiology of Neuro-Urological Disorders,,
Suprapontine and pontine lesions and diseases,,
Neurological Disease,Frequency in General Population,"Type and Frequency of Neuro-
Urological Symptoms"
"Cerebrovascular accident
(Strokes)","450 cases/100,000/yr (Europe) [11], 
10% of cardiovascular mortality.","Nocturia - overactive bladder (OAB) 
- urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) 
- detrusor overactivity (DO), other 
patterns less frequent [12]. 57-83% 
of neuro-urological symptoms at 
one month post-stroke, 71-80% 
spontaneous recovery at six 
months [13]. Persistence of urinary 
incontinence (UI) correlates with 
poor prognosis [14]."
"Dementias:
Alzheimer’s disease (80%),
Vascular (10%), Other (10%).",6.4% of adults > 65 yrs [15].,"OAB - UUI – DO, 25% of 
incontinence in Alzheimer’s
disease, > 25% in other dementias: 
Lewy body, NPH, Binswanger, 
Nasu-Hakola, Pick Disease [16]. 
Incontinence three times more 
frequent in geriatric patients with 
dementia than without [17]."
"Parkinsonian syndrome (PS)
Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease 
(IPD): 75-80% of PS.
Non-IPD: Parkinson’s-plus (18%):
- Multiple system atrophy (MSA),
- Progressive supranuclear palsy,
- Corticobasal degeneration,
- Dementia with Lewy bodies.
Secondary Parkinson’s (2%).","Second most prevalent 
neurodegenerative disease after 
Alzheimer’s disease.
Rising prevalence of IPD with age 
[18].
MSA is the most frequent non-IPD 
PS.","Urinary symptoms affect 50% 
at onset, with urgency and 
nocturia being the most common. 
Patients with urinary symptoms at 
presentation have worse disease 
progression in Parkinson’s disease 
[19].
Infections account for a major cause 
of mortality in MSA [20].
Impaired detrusor contractility with 
post-void residual (PVR) > 150 mL 
seems to be the urodynamic finding 
distinguishing MSA from IPD [21-23]."
Brain tumours,"26.8/100,000/yr in adults (> 19 yrs), 
(17.9 benign, 8.9 malignant) [24].","Incontinence occurs mainly in frontal 
location (part of frontal syndrome or 
isolated in frontal location) [25]."
Cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy: 3.1-3.6/1,000 in 
children aged 8 yrs [26].","46% of patients with cerebral palsy 
suffer from UI, with 85% of patients 
having abnormal urodynamic studies 
(Neurogenic DO most common 
59%). Upper tract deterioration is 
rare (2.5%) [27]."
Traumatic brain injury,"235/100,000/yr [28].","44% storage dysfunction,
38% voiding dysfunction,
60% urodynamic abnormalities [29]."
Normal pressure hydrocephalus,"0.5% of the population > 60, up to 
2.9% of those > 65 [30].","Classic triad of gait and cognitive 
disturbance along with UI. 
Incontinence affects 98-100% of 
patients [30]."
Lesions and diseases between caudal brainstem and sacral spinal cord,,
Spinal cord injury (SCI),"Prevalence of traumatic SCI in
developed countries ranges from 
280 to 906/million [31].","Neurogenic DO and detrusor 
sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) (up to 
95%) and detrusor underactivity (DU) 
(up to 83%) depending on the level 
of the lesion [32]."
Spina bifida (SB),"Spina bifida 3-4/10,000
Lumbar and lumbosacral form are 
the most common (60%) [33].","Bladder function is impaired in up 
to 96% of SB patients [34]. Over 
50% of patients are incontinent 
[35]. Patients with open and closed 
defects can have equally severe 
neurogenic LUT dysfunction [36]."
"Hereditary spastic paraplegia 
(HSP)","Prevalence 1.3-9/100,000 [37].","LUTS in about 75%, mainly urgency 
and voiding dysfunction. Neurogenic 
DO in 81% (of whom 76% with DSD) 
[37]."
Lesions and diseases of the peripheral nervous system,,
"Lumbar spine
Degenerative disease
Disk prolapse
Lumbar canal stenosis","Male (5%) and female (3%) > 35 yr 
have had a lumbosciatic
episode related to disc prolapse.
Incidence: approx. 5/100,000/yr
More common in females > 45 yr.","26% difficulty to void and 
acontractile detrusor [38].
Detrusor underactivity (up to 83%) 
[32]. 
Tarlov cysts: early sensation of 
filling (70%), NDO (33%), urethral 
instability (33%) and stress urinary 
incontinence (SUI) (33%) [39]."
Iatrogenic pelvic nerve lesions,"Rectal cancer.
Cervical cancer (multimodal
therapy, radiotherapy and surgery).
Endometriosis surgery.","After abdomino-perineal resection: 
50% urinary retention.
After total mesorectal excision: 
10-30% voiding dysfunction [40]."
"Peripheral neuropathy Diabetes
Other causes of peripheral
neuropathy causing neuro-
urological symptoms: alcohol 
abuse; lumbosacral zona and 
genital herpes; Guillain Barré 
syndrome; porphyria and 
sarcoidosis.","Worldwide, prevalence of
pharmacologically treated diabetes 
8.3% [41].","Urgency/frequency +/- incontinence 
[42].
Hyposensitive and detrusor
underactivity at later phase [42]."
Disseminated central diseases,,
Multiple sclerosis (MS),"Prevalence: 83/100,000 in Europe 
[43].","10% of MS patients present with
voiding dysfunction at disease onset, 
75% of patients will develop it after 
10 yrs of MS [44].
DO: 65% [44], 43% [45].
DSD: 35% [44, 45].
Detrusor underactivity: 25% [44]."
