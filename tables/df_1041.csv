"4.1.4.1.5.2	Bladder training
Bladder training (BT) is a programme of patient education along with a scheduled voiding regimen with 
gradually increasing intervals. Specific goals are to correct faulty patterns of frequent urination, improve control 
over bladder urgency, prolong voiding intervals, increase bladder capacity, reduce incontinent episodes and
