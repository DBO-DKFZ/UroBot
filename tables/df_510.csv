Summary of evidence and guidelines for epidemiology and risk factors,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Worldwide, bladder cancer is the 10th most commonly diagnosed cancer.",2a
Several risk factors associated with BC diagnosis have been identified.,3
"Active and passive tobacco smoking continues to be the main risk factor, while exposure-related 
incidence is decreasing.",2a
"The increased risk of developing BC in patients undergoing EBRT, brachytherapy, or a combination 
of EBRT and brachytherapy, must be considered during patient follow-up. As BC requires time to 
develop, patients treated with radiation at a young age are at the greatest risk and should be followed-
up closely.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating
Council patients to stop active and avoid passive smoking.,Strong
"Inform workers in potentially hazardous workplaces of the potential carcinogenic effects of 
a number of recognised substances, including duration of exposure and latency periods. 
Protective measures are recommended.",Strong
"Do not prescribe pioglitazone to patients with active bladder cancer or a history of bladder 
cancer.",Strong
