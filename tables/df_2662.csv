Kidney stones
Urolithiasis occurs in 0.2-1.7% of recipients [218, 219]. The most frequent causes are hyper filtration, renal 
tubular acidosis, recurrent UTIs, hypocitraturia, hyperuricaemia, hyperuricemia, excessive alkaline urine, 
persistent tertiary hyperparathyroidism and ureteral strictures [220, 221]. Another risk factor can be urinary 
anastomosis, with the lowest stone rate using Lich-Gregoir technique [219]. The most frequent clinical signs 
are fever, increased serum creatinine level, decreased urine output, and haematuria. Pain is usually not referred 
to due to impaired innervation. A US examination usually provides the diagnosis although a CT of the kidneys, 
ureters and bladder may be needed to confirm the location and size of the stone [220]. The management 
depends on the location and size of the stone, and the presence of obstruction. In case of obstructive 
stones first-line treatment includes placement of a nephrostomy tube, or in some occasions a JJ-stent [222]. 
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is usually considered the first approach for stones < 15 mm with 
stone-free rates varying between 40 and 80% depending on the location of the stone [222]. Ureteroscopy, 
including antegrade and retrograde approaches, can be considered for stones < 20 mm, with a success rate 
of up to 67% [140, 219, 223]. For larger stones (> 20 mm), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) can be offered 
with high overall effective stone-free rates. In cases of large impacted stones, uretero-ureteral anastomosis, 
pyelo-ureteral anastomosis, or uretero-vesical re-implantation may provide excellent results for both stone and 
ureteral obstruction [219]."

"The recurrence rates for transplanted vs. dialysed patients at <1, 1–5, and > 5 years were 0–8% vs. 
2b
0%, 0–27% vs. 0–9% and 0–41% vs. 0–48%, respectively."
"Overall five year survival rates for transplantation vs. dialysed patients were 80–100% vs. 76–100%, 
respectively."
