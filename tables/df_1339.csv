Alpha 1-Adrenoceptor antagonists (α1-blockers)
Mechanism of action: Alpha 1-blockers aim to inhibit the effect of endogenously released noradrenaline on 
smooth muscle cells in the prostate and thereby reduce prostate tone and BOO [143]. However, α1-blockers have 
little effect on urodynamically determined bladder outlet resistance [144], and treatment-associated improvement 
of LUTS correlates poorly with obstruction [145]. Thus, other mechanisms of action may also be relevant.
Alpha 1-adrenoceptors located outside the prostate (e.g. urinary bladder and/or spinal cord) 
and α1-adrenoceptor subtypes (α1B- or α1D-adrenoceptors) may play a role as mediators of effects. Alpha 
1-adrenoceptors in blood vessels, other non-prostatic smooth muscle cells, and the central nervous system 
may mediate adverse events.
Currently available α1-blockers are: alfuzosin hydrochloride (alfuzosin); doxazosin mesylate 
(doxazosin); silodosin; tamsulosin hydrochloride (tamsulosin); terazosin hydrochloride (terazosin); and 
naftopidil. Alpha 1-blockers exist in different formulations. Although different formulations result in different 
pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, the overall difference in clinical efficacy between the difference 
formulations seems negligible.",
