Steroids
Steroids have a large number of side effects [242-244, 295], especially with long-term use. Most practitioners 
still consider steroids (either prednisolone or methylprednisolone) to be a fundamental adjunct to primary 
immunosuppression, even though successful steroid withdrawal has been achieved in the vast majority of 
patients in many prospective, randomised trials [242, 244, 245, 295, 300, 301]. The risk of steroid withdrawal 
depends on the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medication, immunological risk, ethnicity, and 
time after transplantation. Although the risk of rejection diminishes over time, potential benefits may be less 
prominent after a prolonged steroid treatment period [242-245, 295]. Recent studies suggest similar efficacy 
but less diabetes after early steroid withdrawal or steroid minimisation in low-risk patients treated with 
tacrolimus, MPA and induction (either basiliximab or ATG) [302, 303].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Monitor transplant recipients for signs of acute rejection, particularly during the first six 
months post-transplant.",Strong
"Take regular blood samples in addition to regular monitoring of urine output and ultrasound 
examinations in order to detect graft dysfunction during hospitalisation.",Strong
"Immediately rule out other potential causes of graft dysfunction in cases of suspected acute 
rejection. An ultrasound of the kidney transplant should be performed.",Strong
"Perform a renal biopsy, graded according to the most recent Banff criteria, in patients with 
suspected acute rejection episodes.",Strong
"Only if contraindications to renal biopsy are present, can ‘blind’ steroid bolus therapy be 
given.",Strong
"Test patients who suffer acute rejection as soon as possible for anti-HLA antibodies against 
the graft.",Strong
"Reassess the immunosuppressive therapy of all patients with rejection, including patient 
adherence to the medication, which is of particular importance in late rejections.",Strong
