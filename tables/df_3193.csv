Surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile shortness
Current literature reports a wide spectrum of possible surgical interventions aimed to address penile 
shortness. Nonetheless, the proposed spectrum of surgical interventions starts from less invasive procedures 
- such as suspensory ligament release (SLR) - to more complex genital reconstruction - such as total phallic 
reconstruction (TPR) [1493, 1494]. These issues make the surgical treatment of congenital intrinsic penile 
shortness a surgical challenge in urology.",
