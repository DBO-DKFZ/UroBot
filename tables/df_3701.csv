6.3.5.1.2.1	Dilatation of non-traumatic posterior urethral stenosis
This can be done under loco-regional anaesthesia [375-379]. Dilatation is used for VUAS [375-380] or radiation 
induced BMS [381] and in the majority of reported cases, patients were not previously treated for their stricture 
(see supplementary Table S6.12). Patency rates vary widely between 0-89% [117, 375-381]. The risk of de 
novo UI was low (0-11%) and no other complications were reported. It is of note that most series report on 
visually controlled dilatation [375-379] in VUAS without complete obliteration.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Perineal urethrostomy provides very good short- and long-term outcomes for men with complex 
urethral stricture disease.",1a
"Perineal urethrostomy (PU) provides very good short and long-term outcomes for men who are unable 
to have complex reconstruction due to co-morbidities.",2b
All types of PU yield equivalent very good outcomes.,4
"Augmented Gil-Vernet-Blandy or “7-flap” PU yield very good outcomes in men with extension of their 
urethral stricture disease into the proximal bulbar or membranous urethra.",2
“7-flap” PU yields very good results in obese men.,3
