"5.6.5.2.3	 Autologous slings
The strategy of intra-operative placement of an autologous vas deferens sling below the vesico-urethral 
anastomosis during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has been explored with the intention to 
improve early return of continence. Two RCTs [653, 654] showed an advantage of sling vs. no sling at one-
month follow-up, and another study [655] showed an advantage of a 6-branch vs. a 2-branch sling at one 
month follow-up. However, a larger RCT (n=195), showed that continence rate and near-continence rate were 
similar between groups at six months with 66% vs. 65% and 86% vs. 88%, respectively [656].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"A single treatment session of onabotA (100 U) injected in the bladder wall is more effective than 
placebo at curing and improving UUI/OAB symptoms and QoL.",1b
"There is no evidence that repeated injections of onabotA have reduced efficacy, but discontinuation 
rates are high.",3
There is an increased risk of retention and UTI with onabotA injections.,2
