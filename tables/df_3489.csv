Recommendations,Strength rating
"New 2023 recommendation: Offer adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy after RNU 
to patients with pT2–T4 and/or pN+ disease.",Strong
"New 2023 recommendation: Discuss adjuvant nivolumab with patients unfit 
for, or who declined, platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy for > pT3 and/or 
pN+ disease after RNU alone or > ypT2 and/or ypN+ disease after neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, followed by RNU.",Weak
"2022 recommendation: Offer kidney-sparing management to patients with solitary 
kidney and/or impaired renal function, providing that it will not compromise survival. 
This decision will have to be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the 
patient.",Strong
"Revised 2023 recommendation: Offer kidney-sparing management to high-risk 
patients with imperative indication on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with the 
patient.",Strong
"Erdafitinib was associated with radiological response in platinum-refractory patients with 
locally-advanced or metastatic UC and FGFR DNA genomic alterations (FGFR2/3 mutations 
or FGFR3 fusions).",2a
"Enfortumab vedotin was associated with OS benefit in patients who had previously received 
platinum-containing chemotherapy and experienced disease progression during or after 
treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.",1b
Palliative nephroureterectomy can improve quality of life by controlling symptomatic disease.,3
RNU can confer a survival benefit in highly selected patients.,4
