Diagnostic evaluation
Patients usually present with scrotal pain, except in neonatal torsion. The sudden onset of invalidating pain in 
combination with vomiting is typical for torsion of the testis or appendix testis [232, 233]. 
In general, the duration of symptoms at presentation is shorter in testicular torsion (69% present 
within twelve hours) and torsion of the appendix testis (62%) compared to epididymitis (31%) [203, 204, 229]. 
Prepubertal males are more likely to present with atypical symptoms and delayed presentation and diagnosis, 
leading to delayed surgical intervention and a higher rate of orchiectomy, compared to postpubertal boys [234].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"In the majority of infants, surgical treatment of hydrocele is not indicated within the first twelve 
months due to the tendency for spontaneous resolution. Little risk is taken by initial observation as 
progression to hernia is rare.",2a
"In the paediatric age group, an operation would generally involve ligation of the patent processus 
vaginalis via inguinal incision.",4
