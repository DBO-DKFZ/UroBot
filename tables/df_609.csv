Urinary tract infection in neuro-urological patients
3.5.1	
Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology
Urinary tract infection is the onset of signs and/or symptoms accompanied by laboratory findings of a UTI 
(bacteriuria, leukocyturia and positive urine culture) [374]. There are no evidence-based cut-off values for the 
quantification of these findings. The published consensus is that a significant bacteriuria in persons performing 
IC is present with > 102 cfu/mL, > 104 cfu/mL in clean-void specimens and any detectable concentration 
in suprapubic aspirates. Regarding leukocyturia, ten or more leukocytes in centrifuged urine samples per 
microscopic field (400x) are regarded as significant [374].",
