Summary of evidence and guidelines for pre- and post-operative radiotherapy,
Summary of evidence,LE
No contemporary data exists to support that pre-operative RT for operable MIBC increases survival.,2a
"Pre-operative RT for operable MIBC, using a dose of 45–50 Gy in fractions of 1.8–2 Gy, results in 
down-staging after 4 to 6 weeks.",2
"Limited evidence supports the safe use of pre- and post-operative RT in case a neobladder is planned 
or in situ.",3
"Limited high-quality evidence supports the use of pre-operative RT to decrease local recurrence of 
MIBC after RC.",3
"Addition of adjuvant RT to chemotherapy is associated with an improvement in local relapse-free 
survival following cystectomy for locally-advanced bladder cancer (pT3b–4, or node-positive).",2a
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Do not offer pre-operative radiotherapy (RT) for operable muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
since it will only result in down-staging, but will not improve survival.",Strong
"Do not offer pre-operative RT when subsequent radical cystectomy (RC) with urinary 
diversion is planned.",Strong
"Consider offering adjuvant RT in addition to chemotherapy following RC, based on 
pathologic risk (pT3b–4 or positive nodes or positive margins).",Weak
