Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,
"Offer panurethral urethroplasties in specialised centres because different techniques and 
materials might be needed.",Weak,,,,,
"Combine techniques to treat panurethral strictures if one technique is not able to treat the 
whole extent of the stricture.",Weak,,,,,
