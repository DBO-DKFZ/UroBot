Anastomotic urethroplasty in men with penile urethral strictures
Historically, the use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been 
discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively [263, 284]. Nevertheless, it has been performed in 
selected patients with very short strictures (usually < 1 cm) with 80-93% patency rate, with satisfactory QoL 
and sexual function and without any case of chordee [285] and with results comparable to augmentation 
urethroplasty [286].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Lichen sclerosus is a skin condition that can lead to scarring, and recurrence rates after skin graft/flap 
augmentation urethroplasties have been reported to be high (50-100%).",4
"Single-stage oral mucosa graft (OMG) urethroplasty provides patency rates between 65 and 100% 
and is not inferior to staged OMG urethroplasty.",3
