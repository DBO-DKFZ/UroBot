Impact on fertility and fertility-associated issues
Sperm abnormalities and Leydig cell dysfunction are frequently found in patients with TCs prior to 
orchidectomy [89, 90]. Up to 24% of TC patients are azoospermic and almost 50% have abnormal sperm 
counts (oligozo-ospemic) before treatment [90].",

nodes, breast, and testicles.",Strong
"Measure serum tumour markers both before and after orchidectomy taking into account 
half-life kinetics.",Strong
"Perform orchidectomy and pathological examination of the testis to confirm the diagnosis 
and to define the local extension (pT category). In a life-threatening situation due to 
extensive metastasis, commence chemotherapy prior to orchidectomy.",Strong
