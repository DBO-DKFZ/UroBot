with metastatic disease and favourable disease factors and in whom complete resection is 
achievable.",Weak
"Offer stereotactic radiotherapy for clinically relevant bone- or brain metastases for local 
control and symptom relief.",Weak
"Do not offer tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment to mRCC patients after metastasectomy and 
no evidence of disease.",Strong
"Perform a confirmatory axial scan of disease status prior to metastasectomy to rule out
