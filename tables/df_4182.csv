3.11.4.8  Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnosis of bacterial prostatitis,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Urine dipstick testing for nitrite and leukocytes has a positive predictive value of 95% and a negative 
predictive value of 70% in patients with ABP.",3
"The four-glass Meares and Stamey test is the optimum test for diagnosis of CBP. The two-glass test 
has been shown to offer similar diagnostic sensitivity in a comparison study.",2b
"First-void urine is the preferred specimen for the diagnosis of urogenital C. trachomatis infection in 
men by NAATs.",2b
Transrectal ultrasound is unreliable and cannot be used as a diagnostic tool in prostatitis.,3
"Semen culture sensitivity is reported to be approximately 50%; therefore, it is not routinely part of the 
diagnostic assessment of CBP.",3
"Prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated during active prostatitis; therefore, PSA testing 
should be avoided as it offers no practical diagnostic information for prostatitis.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating
Do not perform prostatic massage in acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP).,Strong
"Take a mid-stream urine dipstick to check nitrite and leukocytes in patients with clinical 
suspicion of ABP.",Weak
"Take a mid-stream urine culture in patients with ABP symptoms to guide diagnosis and 
tailor antibiotic treatment.",Weak
Take a blood culture and a total blood count in patients presenting with ABP.,Weak
"Perform accurate microbiological evaluation for atypical pathogens such as Chlamydia 
trachomatis or Mycoplasmata in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP).",Weak
Perform the Meares and Stamey 2- or 4-glass test in patients with CBP.,Strong
"Perform transrectal ultrasound in selected cases to rule out the presence of prostatic 
abscess.",Weak
Do not routinely perform microbiological analysis of the ejaculate alone to diagnose CBP.,Weak
