Diagnostic evaluation
Assessment of pain is the first step in pain management. Several pain assessment tools have been validated 
according to the child’s age, cultural background, mental status, communication skills and physiological 
reactions [1494]. Depending on the child’s age, the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale, Faces Revised Pain Scale or 
Colour Analog Scale, for example, can be used [1495]. One of the most important topics in paediatric pain 
management is informing and involving the child and caregivers during this process. Patient-family-controlled-
analgesia is the preferred pain management in the hospital and at home if provided with the correct information 
[1495, 1496].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Ensure shorter pre-operative fasting periods for elective surgeries (up to one hour for clear 
liquids).",Strong
"Use enhanced recovery after surgery protocols for abdominal surgery in children with 
normal bowel movement.",Strong
"Use isotonic solutions in hospitalised children because they are at high risk of developing 
hyponatraemia.",Strong
"Assess the baseline and daily levels of serum electrolytes, glucose, urea and/or creatinine 
in every child who receives intravenous fluids, especially in intestinal surgery (e.g. ileal 
augmentation), regardless of the type of solution chosen since there is an increased risk of 
electrolyte abnormalities in children undergoing such surgery.",Strong
Start early oral fluid intake in all patients scheduled for minor surgical procedures.,Strong
