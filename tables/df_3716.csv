"6.3.5.2.1.2	Endoluminal treatment after failed urethroplasty for post-traumatic posterior stenosis
In case of a non-obliterative and short (< 1 cm) recurrence after failed urethroplasty, endoluminal treatment can 
be performed [437]. Although a 1st and 2nd DVIU can be successful with a stricture-free rate of 22.9-77.3% and 
0-60% respectively, three or more incisions are never successful (see supplementary Table S6.16) [437-440]. 
Therefore, repetitive endoluminal treatments (dilations and/or endoscopic incisions) can only be considered as 
a palliative option [441].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Perform flow rate, post-void residual and voiding cystourethrogram or video-urodynamics in 
all women with refractory lower urinary tract symptoms.",Strong
Perform urethral dilatation to 24-41 Fr as initial treatment of female urethral stricture (FUS).,Weak
"Perform repeat urethral dilatation and start planned weekly intermittent self-dilatation (ISD) 
with a 16-18 Fr catheter for the 1st recurrence of FUS, or plan repeat dilatation.",Weak
"Perform urethroplasty in women with a 2nd recurrence of FUS and who cannot perform ISD 
or wish definitive treatment. The technique for urethroplasty should  be determined by the 
surgeon’s experience, availability and quality of graft/flap material and quality of the ventral 
versus dorsal urethra.",Strong
Treat meatal strictures by meatotomy/meatoplasty.,Weak
