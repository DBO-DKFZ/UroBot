Summary of evidence and guidelines for local treatment of penile carcinoma,
Summary of evidence,LE
Penile intra-epithelial neoplasia progress to invasive lesions in 2.6–13% despite treatment.,3
"Response and recurrence rates of topical therapies for PeIN are 40–100% and 20% for IQ and 
48–74% and 11% for 5-FU. For laser therapy, response rates are 52–100% and recurrence rates 
7–48%. For glans resurfacing, recurrence rates are as low as 4%.",3
"A SR including retrospective studies on organ-sparing surgical treatment of the primary lesion 
shows that cumulative mean 5-year RFRs are 82% in case series and 76.7% in non-RCTs. For 
(partial) amputative surgery these are 83.9% in case series and 93.3% in non-controlled studies. The 
cumulative mean 5-year RFR was 69.4% for patients treated with laser therapy for invasive disease.",3
Current literature on frozen section analysis in organ-sparing surgery is heterogeneous and conflicting.   3,
"Tumour distance to the resection margin < 1 mm resulted in higher local recurrence rates in a recent 
large retrospective case series from a tertiary referral centre.",3
"Several retrospective series from claims databases and high-volume centres studying non-specified 
organ-sparing surgical and ablative techniques show no impact of local recurrence on CSS where 
case mix is pitched towards lower grade, lower stage tumours. However, a recent large retrospective 
series of glansectomies performed in high-volume centres showed local recurrence was a predictor of 
poor CSS in a cohort with a high number of T2, T3 and high-grade lesions.",3
The cumulative mean 5-year RFRs are 78.6% after brachytherapy and 55.2% after EBRT.,3
"For neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, pooled ORR was 53% (95% CI: 42–64%), the pCR rate in 
prospective studies was 4–10% (95% CI: 5–30%) in a recent SR and meta-analysis.",2a
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer a balanced and individualised discussion on benefits and harms of possible 
treatments options with the goal of shared decision making.",Strong
"Inform patients of the higher risk of local recurrence when using organ-sparing treatments 
compared to amputative surgery.",Strong
Topical therapy,
"Weak
Offer topical therapy with 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod to patients with biopsy-confirmed 
penile intra-epithelial neoplasia (PeIN).",
"Clinically assess treatment effects after a treatment-free interval and in cases of doubt 
Weak
perform a biopsy. If topical treatment fails, it should not be repeated.",
Laser ablation,
"Weak
Offer laser ablation using CO2 or Nd:YAG laser to patients with biopsy-confirmed PeIN,  
Ta or T1 lesions.",
"Organ-sparing treatment: surgery (circumcision, wide local excision, glansectomy and glans resurfacing)",
"Offer organ-sparing surgery and reconstructive techniques to patients with lesions confined 
to the glans and prepuce (PeIN, Ta, T1–T2) and who are willing to comply with strict follow-up.",Strong
"Perform intra-operative frozen section analysis of resection margins in cases of doubt on 
the completeness of resection.",Weak
"Offer salvage organ-sparing surgery to patients with small recurrences not involving the 
corpora cavernosa.",Weak
Organ-sparing treatment: radiotherapy (EBRT and brachytherapy),
"Offer radiotherapy to selected patients with biopsy-confirmed T1 or T2 lesions. 
Strong",
Amputative surgery (partial- and total penectomy),
"Offer partial penectomy, with or without reconstruction, to patients with invasion of the 
corpora cavernosa (T3) and those not willing to undergo organ-sparing surgery or not willing 
to comply with strict follow-up.",Strong
"Offer total penectomy with perineal urethrostomy to patients with large invasive tumours not 
amenable to partial amputation.",Strong
"Offer amputative surgery to patients with large local recurrences or corpora cavernosa 
involvement.",Weak
Multimodal therapy,
"Weak
Offer induction chemotherapy followed by surgery to responders, or chemo-radiotherapy 
to patients with non-resectable advanced primary lesions, or to patients with locally 
advanced-disease who refuse surgical management.",
