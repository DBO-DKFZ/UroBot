Summary of evidence,LE,
"Non-contrast-enhanced CT is used to confirm stone diagnosis in patients with acute flank pain, as it is 
superior to IVU.",1a,
"Enhanced CT enables 3D reconstruction of the collecting system, as well as measurement of stone 
density and skin-to-stone distance.",2a,
Recommendations,Strength rating,
"Immediate imaging is indicated with fever or solitary kidney, and when diagnosis is doubtful.",Strong,
"Use non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography to confirm stone diagnosis in patients 
with acute flank pain following initial ultrasound assessment.",Strong,
"Perform a contrast study if stone removal is planned and the anatomy of the renal collecting 
system needs to be assessed.",Strong,
