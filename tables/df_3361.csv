Impact on fertility and fertility-associated issues
Sperm abnormalities and Leydig cell dysfunction are frequently found in patients with TCs prior to 
orchidectomy [89, 90]. Up to 24% of TC patients are azoospermic and almost 50% have abnormal sperm 
counts (oligozo-ospemic) before treatment [90].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Poor sperm quality is frequently found in TC patients, before and after treatment. Semen preservation 
is the most cost-effective strategy for fertility preservation.",2b
"Serum tumour markers (AFP, β-hCG and LDH) should be determined before and after orchidectomy 
and throughout follow-up. They are used for accurate staging, risk stratification, to monitor treatment 
and to detect relapse.",2b
"For abdominal staging, CECT has a median sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 67%, 
95%, 87%, 73% and 83%, respectively. Sensitivity decreases and specificity increases with increasing 
lymph node size.",2a
"For chest staging, CECT has a median sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 100%, 93%, 
68%, 100% and 93%, respectively.",2a
"Magnetic resonance imaging and CECT are key image modalities for the detection of brain metastasis. 
Magnetic resonance imaging is far more sensitive than CECT, though it does require expertise.",2b
"Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography has a limited diagnostic accuracy for staging 
before chemotherapy.",2b
There are no high-level evidence studies supporting screening programs.,2b
"In TSS, FSE has shown to be reliable and highly concordant with final histopathology.",1b
There is no evidence supporting any size criteria for a testicular lesion to be safely followed-up.,2b
"In patients without risk factors, there is low incidence of contralateral GCNIS and of metachronous GCT.",2b
