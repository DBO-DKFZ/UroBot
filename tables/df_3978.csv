Recommendations,,Strength rating
Investigation,Rationale for investigation,
Take a medical history,"• Stone history (former stone events, family history)
• Dietary habits
• Medication chart",Strong
Perform diagnostic imaging,"• Ultrasound in the case of a suspected stone
• Un-enhanced helical computed tomography
• Determination of Hounsfield units provides
• Information about the possible stone composition",Strong
Perform a blood analysis,"• Creatinine
• Calcium (ionised calcium or total calcium + albumin)
• Uric acid",Strong
Perform a urinalysis,"F
•  Urine pH profile (measurement after each voiding, 
minimum four times daily)
•  Dipstick test: leukocytes, erythrocytes, nitrites, 
protein, urine pH, specific weight
• Urine cultures
• Microscopy of urinary sediment (morning urine)
• Cyanide nitroprusside test (cystine exclusion)
urther examinations depend on the results of the 
investigations listed above.",Strong
