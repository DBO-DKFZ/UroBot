High-flow priapism in children
Non-ischaemic priapism is a rare condition, especially in children. The embarrassment that children may have 
in speaking about it to their parents can lead to misdiagnosis and underestimating the prevalence of this 
condition [1744]. The aetiology, clinical presentation and diagnostic and therapeutic principles are comparable 
with those of arterial priapism in adults. However, some differentiating features should be noted.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Non-ischaemic priapism can cause erectile dysfunction over time and early definitive management 
should be undertaken.",3
"Conservative management applying ice to the perineum or site-specific perineal compression is an 
option in all cases. The use of androgen deprivation therapy may enable closure of the fistula reducing 
spontaneous and sleep-related erections.",3
"Selective artery embolisation, using temporary or permanent substances, has high success rates. No 
definitive statement can be made on the best substance for embolisation in terms of sexual function 
preservation and success rate.",3
Repeated embolisation is a reasonable option for the treatment of non-ischaemic priapism.,2b
"Selective surgical ligation of the fistula should be reserved as the last treatment option when multiple 
embolisations have failed.",3
