"5.6.5.2.3	 Autologous slings
The strategy of intra-operative placement of an autologous vas deferens sling below the vesico-urethral 
anastomosis during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has been explored with the intention to 
improve early return of continence. Two RCTs [653, 654] showed an advantage of sling vs. no sling at one-
month follow-up, and another study [655] showed an advantage of a 6-branch vs. a 2-branch sling at one 
month follow-up. However, a larger RCT (n=195), showed that continence rate and near-continence rate were 
similar between groups at six months with 66% vs. 65% and 86% vs. 88%, respectively [656].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"There is limited short-, medium- and long-term evidence that fixed transobturator male slings cure or 
improve PPI in patients with mild-to-moderate incontinence.",1b
"Men with severe incontinence, previous radiotherapy or transurethral surgery may have less benefit 
from fixed transobturator male slings.",2
There is limited evidence that adjustable male slings can cure or improve SUI in men.,3
There is no evidence that adjustability offers additional benefit over other types of slings.,3
"There is no evidence that intra-operative placement of an autologous sling during RARP improves 
return of continence at six months.",1b
