Diagnostic evaluation
The classic description of a communicating hydrocele is that of a hydrocele that fluctuates in size, 
and is usually related to ambulation. It may be diagnosed by history-taking and physical investigation. 
Transillumination of the scrotum provides the diagnosis in the majority of cases, keeping in mind that fluid 
filled intestine and some pre-pubertal tumours may transilluminate as well [189, 190]. If the diagnosis is that 
of a hydrocele, there will be no history of reducibility and no associated symptoms; the swelling is translucent, 
smooth and usually not tender. If there are any doubts about the character of an intrascrotal mass, scrotal US 
should be performed and has nearly 100% sensitivity in detecting intrascrotal lesions. Doppler US studies 
help to distinguish hydroceles from varicocele and testicular torsion, although these conditions may also be 
accompanied by a hydrocele.",,
