Table 3.2: Other renal cortical tumours and recommendations for treatment (strength rating: weak),,,
Entity,Clinical relevant notes,Malignant potential,Treatment
"Collecting duct 
carcinoma","Formerly bellini duct carcinoma. 
No hemoglobinopathy or 
SMARCB1 abnormality. Rare, 
often presenting at an advanced 
stage (N+ 44% and M1, 33% 
at diagnosis). The HR CSS in 
comparison with ccRCC is 4.49 
[23, 24, 29].","High, very aggressive. 
Median survival 30 
months [70].","Surgery. Response to 
targeted therapies is 
poor [71]."
"Clear-cell papillary renal 
cell tumour","Patient with ACKD, 100 times 
greater risk compared with 
general population [24].",Indolent,"Surgery, NSS, discuss 
active surveilance."
"Mucinous tubular and 
spindle cell carcinoma","Tumour is associated with the 
loop of Henle. < 1% of renal 
neoplasm. Female predilection 
(3–4:1) [24].",Intermediate,"Surgery, NSS."
Tubulocystic RCC,"Rare (< 1%). Mainly men, 
imaging can be Bosniak III or IV.",Low (90% indolent),"Surgery, NSS."
"Eosinophilic solid and 
cystic RCC (ESC RCC)","Usually alteration of TCS genes. 
Predominantly in adult women. 
Some with TSC (tuberous 
sclerosis complex) syndrome.",Rarely metastatic.,NSS.
TFE3 re-arranged RCC,"Gene fusions involving TFE3 with 
one of many different partner 
genes. Formerly translocation 
RCC (TRCC) Xp11.2. Appr. 40% 
of paediatric RCC and 1.6–4% of 
adult RCC [24].","Survival similar to clear 
cell RCC","Surgery. Systemic 
therapy in metastatic 
disease."
TFEB re-arranged RCC,"Gene fusions involving the  
TFEB transcription factor, 
typically via a t(6;11)(p21;q12) 
translocation resulting in a 
MALAT1-TFEB gene fusion. 
Formerly translocation RCC 
t(6;11). Less common than TFE3-
re-arranged RCC. Appr. 100  
cases in the literature [24].","More indolent than the 
TFE3-rearranged RCC, 
with fewer than 10% 
of cases resulting in 
patient death.","Surgery. Systemic 
therapy in metastatic 
disease."
"ELOC (formerly TCBE1)-
mutated RCC","Twenty cases described in 
literature. Typically T1.","Indolent. Only 2 
metastatic cases 
described.",NSS.
"Fumarate hydratase-
deficient RCC","Formerly hereditary 
leiomyomatosis and RCC-
associated RCC. Alterations 
in the FH gene. Autosomal 
dominant. 21–30% lifetime 
risk of RCC [58]. Cutanous 
leiomyomas, female uterine 
leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma. 
More common in males. Median 
age 44 years [23, 27, 72].",Often aggressive.,"Immediate surgery. No 
data about treatment 
of metastatic disease. 
Genetic counselling 
in the family. Imaging 
screening in relatives 
[58]."
"Succinate 
dehydrogenase-
deficient RCC (SDH-
deficient RCC)",Rare. 0.05–0.2 % of all RCCs.,"A metastatic rate of 
11%","Surgery, NSS. Long-
term follow-up and 
surveillance for 
other SDH-deficient 
neoplasms (i.e. 
paraganglioma, SDH-
deficient gastrointestinal 
stromal tumour, and 
pituitary adenoma) is 
indicated for cases 
associated with 
germline mutation [23]."
ALK-rearranged RCC,"Gene fusions involving anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) 
at chromosome 2p23. Appr. 40 
cases described.",Low (90% indolent),"Surgery, NSS."
Metanephric tumours,"Divided into metanephric 
adenoma, adenofibroma, and 
metanephric stromal tumours.",Benign,NSS.
"Mixed epithelial and 
stromal renal tumour","It encompasses 2 benign 
leasions - mixed epithelial 
and stromal tumour of the 
kidney (MEST) and adult cystic 
nephroma. Imaging – Bosniak 
type III or IIF/IV. Overwhelmingly 
in women (7:1).",Benign,"Active surveillance. 
NSS."
"Renal cysts/cystic 
lesions","Simple cysts are frequently 
occurring, while occurring 
septa, calcifications and solid 
components require follow-up 
and/or management.",Mostly benign,"Treatment or follow-
up recommendation 
based on Bosniak 
classification."
