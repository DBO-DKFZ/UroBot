Table 4: Most used parameters to measure detrusor contraction in female patients,,,
Parameter,Basis,Population,Values
Watt’s factor [469],"Hill equation of muscle 
contraction in a spherical 
organ, with fixed 
constants obtained from 
experimental and clinical 
studies","Eight asymptomatic 
female volunteers aged 
28–45 years (median 34 
years)","Ideal voiding (bell-shaped flow 
curves): WFmax 11-24 W/m2
Non-ideal voiding: WFmax  
5−10 W/m2
Normally WFmax > 7 W/m2 
(expert opinion, unspecified 
population) [474]"
"Projected isovolumetric 
pressure (cm H2O) and 
BCI, using PIP as an 
index [470, 475]","Bladder output relation, 
simplified to a straight line 
with fixed slope of  
5 cm H2O/mL/s (formula: 
PdetQmax + 5xQmax)","Unspecified population, 
mainly men with BPO","Classification based on expert 
opinion:
> 150: strong contraction
100–150: normal contraction
50–100: weak contraction
< 50: very weak contraction"
"Projected isovolumetric 
pressure 1 (cm H2O) 
[471]","Comparison of Qmax and 
PdetQmax values with stop 
test results
(Formula: pdetQmax + Qmax)","100 women with UUI 
aged 53–89 (mean 70) 
years","5th-95th percentile: 29–78 cm 
H2O
Mean: 49 cm H2O
Median: 48 cm H2O
Proposed typical values: 
30-75 cm H2O"
"Continuous occlusion 
test [472]","Direct measurement of 
isovolumetric voiding 
contraction","70 women with UUI 
aged 53–89 (mean: 70) 
years","Mean ± SD: 48.7 ± 24.4 cm 
H2O"
