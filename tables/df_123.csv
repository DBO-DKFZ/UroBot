"6.4.1.2	
Adjuvant chemotherapy 
There are known poor prognostic characteristics for a subset of patients with resected high-risk disease (such 
as involved pelvic LNs), indicating the likely presence of micrometastatic disease. Data exists on response 
rates for those with metastatic disease and there is possible benefit for pre-operative chemotherapy for those 
with unresectable locally advanced disease as described above. With extrapolation from other diseases, it 
stands to reason that systemic therapy following resection (i.e., adjuvant therapy) may improve outcomes.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy using a cisplatin- and taxane-based combination to 
chemotherapy-fit patients with pelvic lymph node involvement or those with extensive 
inguinal involvement (cN3), in preference to up front surgery.",Weak
"Offer chemotherapy as an alternative approach to upfront surgery to selected patients with 
bulky mobile inguinal nodes or bilateral disease (cN2) who are candidates for cisplatin and 
taxane-based chemotherapy.",Weak
"Have a balanced discussion of risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy with high-risk 
patients with surgically resected disease, in particular with those with pathological pelvic LN 
involvement (pN3). See also section on post-operative radiotherapy.",Weak
