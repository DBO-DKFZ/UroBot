For acute treatment, site and severity are most important.",2b,
"The number of colony forming units (cfu) in the urine culture can vary, however, any colony count of 
one specimen indicates a high suspicion for UTI.",2b,
"Due to increasing resistance numbers good antibiotic stewardship should guide the choice of 
antibiotics, taking into account local resistance patterns, old urine cultures (when available) and 
clinical parameters.",2a,
