"7.4.4.2	
Combination treatment using interferon
In a Cochrane meta-analysis of 4 RCTs, a combination of BCG and IFN-2α did not show a clear difference 
in recurrence and progression over BCG alone [347]. In one study, weekly MMC followed by monthly BCG 
alternating with IFN-2α showed a higher probability of recurrence compared to MMC followed by BCG alone 
[348]. Additionally, a RCT in a similar population of NMIBC comparing BCG monotherapy with a combination 
of epirubicin and INF for up to two years showed the latter was significantly inferior to BCG monotherapy in 
preventing recurrence [349] (LE: 1b).",
Summary of evidence,LE
"In patients with intermediate- and high-risk tumours, intravesical BCG after TURB reduces the risk of 
tumour recurrence; it is more effective than TURB alone or TURB and intravesical chemotherapy.",1a
"For optimal efficacy, BCG must be given in a maintenance schedule.",1a
"Three-year maintenance is more effective than one year to prevent recurrence in patients with high-
risk tumours, but not in patients with intermediate-risk tumours.",1a
