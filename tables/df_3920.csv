Percutaneous irrigation chemolysis
Percutaneous chemolysis is rarely used nowadays, for practical reasons. Percutaneous irrigation chemolysis 
may be an option for infection-stones and theoretically also for uric acid stones. For dissolution of struvite 
stones, Suby’s G solution (10% hemiacidrin; pH 3.5-4) can be used. The method has been described in case 
series and literature reviews [145-147].",
