Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of obstructive pathology of 
renal duplication: ureterocele and ectopic ureter",,,,
Recommendations,,,LE,Strength rating
Ureterocele,Diagnosis,"Use ultrasound (US), radionuclide studies
(mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3)/
dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)), voiding 
cystourethrography (VCUG),
magnetic resonance urography, high-resolution
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cystoscopy 
to assess function, to detect reflux and rule out 
ipsilateral compression of the lower pole and urethral 
obstruction.",3,Weak
,Treatment,"Select treatment based on symptoms, function and 
reflux as well on surgical and parenteral choices: 
observation, endoscopic decompression, ureteral 
re-implantation, partial nephroureteretomy, complete
primary reconstruction. Offer, early endoscopic 
decompression to patients with an obstructing 
ureterocele.",3,Weak
Ectopic ureter,Diagnosis,"Use US, DMSA scan, VCUG or MRI for a definitive 
diagnosis.",3,Weak
,Treatment,"Treatment In non-functioning moieties with
recurrent infections, heminephro-ureterectomy is a 
definitive solution. Ureteral reconstruction (ureteral 
re-implantation/ureteroureterostomy/
ureteropyelostomy and upper pole ureterectomy) are 
other therapeutic option especially in cases in which 
the upper pole has function worth preserving.",3,Weak
