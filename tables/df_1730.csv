Summary of evidence and recommendations for the management of hypospadias",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"At birth, differentiate isolated hypospadias from disorders of sex development which are 
mostly associated with cryptorchidism or micropenis.",Strong
"Counsel caregivers on functional indications for surgery, aesthetically feasible operative 
procedures (psychological, cosmetic indications) and possible complications.",Strong
"In children diagnosed with proximal hypospadias and a small appearing penis, reduced 
glans circumference or reduced urethral plate, pre-operative hormonal androgen stimulation 
treatment is an option and the body of evidence to accentuate its harms and benefits is 
inadequate.",Weak
"For distal hypospadias, offer Duplay-Thiersch urethroplasty, original and modified 
tubularised incised plate urethroplasty; use the onlay urethroplasty or two-stage procedures 
in more severe hypospadias. A treatment algorithm is presented (Figure 3). Correct 
significant (> 30 degrees) curvature of the penis.",Weak
"Ensure long-term follow-up to detect urethral stricture, voiding dysfunctions and recurrent 
penile curvature, ejaculation disorder, and to evaluate patient´s satisfaction.",Strong
"Use validated objective scoring systems to assist in evaluating the functional and cosmetic 
outcome.",Strong
