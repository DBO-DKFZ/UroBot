tumour, if bladder carcinoma in situ is present or suspected, if there is positive cytology or 
urinary molecular marker test without evidence of tumour in the bladder, or if abnormalities 
of the prostatic urethra are visible. If biopsy is not performed during the initial procedure, it 
should be completed at the time of the second resection.",Strong

and multifocality, all steps of the procedure, as well as extent and completeness of resection.",Weak
