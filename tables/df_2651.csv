Arterial thrombosis
Transplant renal artery thrombosis is a rare complication with a prevalence ranging from 0.5-3.5% [179]. 
Usually, it is a consequence of a technical error during the anastomosis although other causes may be 
related to both the donor and recipient’s artery condition (i.e. atherosclerosis), intimal rupture during kidney 
harvesting, acute rejection episodes, external compression by haematoma or lymphocele, hypercoagulative 
state, severe hypotension, and toxicity of immunosuppressive agents (cyclosporine or sirolimus) [180]. The 
clinical manifestations are acute reduction of urine output and the elevation of renal function tests, often 
resulting in graft loss [177]. The diagnosis is obtained with eco-colour-Doppler [177]. Surgical exploration 
is usually recommended to evaluate the status of the graft. In the rare event the graft appears salvageable, 
a thrombectomy must be performed. In this situation, the iliac artery is clamped and an arteriotomy vs. a 
dissection of the vascular anastomosis must be performed in order to remove the clot. The graft can be flushed 
in-situ and re-vascularised [177]. Unfortunately, in the majority of the situations, the graft is not perfused 
and therefore an allograft nephrectomy must be performed [177, 181]. Alternatively, thrombolytic agent 
administration through a catheter directly into the transplant renal artery can be an efficient treatment, after the 
first ten to fourteen post-transplantation days [177].",

"The diagnosis of renal artery thrombosis depends on eco-colour-Doppler followed by surgical 
exploration to assess the status of the graft.",2b

are the treatment options for renal artery thrombosis.",2b
