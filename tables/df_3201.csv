Recommendations for the treatment of ischaemic priapism",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Start management of ischaemic priapism as early as possible (within four to six hours) and 
follow a stepwise approach.",Strong
"First, decompress the corpus cavernosum by penile aspiration and washout until fresh red 
blood is obtained.",Strong
"In priapism secondary to intracavernous injections of vasoactive agents, replace blood 
aspiration with intracavernous injection of a sympathomimetic drug as the first step.",Strong
"In priapism that persists despite aspiration, proceed to the next step, which is 
intracavernous injection of a sympathomimetic drug.",Strong
"In cases that persist despite aspiration and intracavernous injection of a sympathomimetic 
drug, repeat these steps before considering surgical intervention.",Strong
"Treat ischaemic priapism associated with sickle cell disease in the same fashion as 
idiopathic ischaemic priapism. Provide other supportive measures (intravenous hydration, 
oxygen administration with alkalisation with bicarbonate, blood exchange transfusions), but 
do not delay initial treatment to the penis.",Strong
"Proceed to surgical treatment only when blood aspiration and intracavernous injection of 
sympathomimetic drugs have failed.",Strong
Perform distal shunt surgical procedures first and combine them with tunnelling if necessary.,Weak
"Proximal procedures may be used in cases of distal shunt failure (< 48 hours) or in patients 
who do not wish to proceed with immediate penile implant insertion.",Weak
Peri- and post-operative anticoagulation may decrease priapism recurrence.,Weak
"A penile prosthesis may be preferred over proximal shunting particularly in delayed > 48 
hours) or refractory priapism.",Weak
"Implantation of a prosthesis may be considered in delayed presentation (> 48 hours) and in 
those cases refractory to injection therapy and distal shunting.",Weak
"If a shunt has been performed, then implantation of a penile prosthesis should be delayed 
to minimise the risk of infection and erosion of the implant.",Strong
"The decision on which type of implant to insert is dependent on patient suitability, surgeons’ 
experience and availability and cost of the equipment. If malleable penile prosthesis is 
implanted it can be later exchanged to an ınflatable penıle implant.",Strong
"Patients must be fully counselled regarding the risks and benefits of implant insertion in 
cases of delayed presentation of refractory priapism.",Weak
