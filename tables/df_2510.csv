7.4.4.4.1	 Renal medullary carcinoma
Renal medullary carcinoma is one of the most aggressive RCCs [29, 194] and most patients (~67%) will present 
with metastatic disease [29, 31]. Even patients who present with seemingly localised disease may develop 
macrometastases shortly thereafter, often within a few weeks.
Despite treatment, median OS is thirteen months in the most recent series [35]. Due to the 
infiltrative nature and medullary epicentre of RMC, RN is favoured over PN even in very early-stage disease. 
Retrospective data indicate that nephrectomy in localised disease results in superior OS (16.4 vs. 7 months) 
compared with systemic chemotherapy alone, but longer survival was noted in patients who achieved an 
objective response to first-line chemotherapy [35, 560]. There is currently no established role for distant 
metastasectomy or nephrectomy in the presence of metastases.
Palliative radiation therapy is an option and may achieve regression in the targeted areas but it 
will not prevent progression outside the radiation field [561, 562]. Renal medullary carcinoma is refractory 
to monotherapies with targeted anti-angiogenic regimens including TKIs and mTOR inhibitors [35, 169]. The 
mainstay systemic treatments for RMC are cytotoxic combination regimens which produce partial or complete 
responses in ~29% of patients [169]. There are no prospective comparisons between different chemotherapy 
regimens, but most published series used various combinations of platinum agents, taxanes, gemcitabine, 
and/or anthracyclines [35, 36]. High-dose-intensity combination of MVAC has also shown efficacy against 
RMC [563] although a retrospective comparison did not show superiority of MVAC over cisplatin, paclitaxel, 
and gemcitabine [36]. Single-agent anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint therapy has produced responses in a few 
case reports, although, as yet, insufficient data are available to determine the response rate to this approach 
[561, 562]. Whenever possible, patients should be enrolled in clinical trials of novel therapeutic approaches, 
particularly after failing first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy.",
