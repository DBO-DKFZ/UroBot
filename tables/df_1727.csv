Acute scrotum
3.5.1	
Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology
Acute scrotum is a paediatric urological emergency, most commonly caused by torsion of the testis or 
appendix testis, or epididymitis/epididymo-orchitis [201-206]. Other causes of acute scrotal pain are idiopathic 
scrotal oedema, mumps orchitis, varicocele, scrotal haematoma, incarcerated hernia, appendicitis or systemic 
disease (e.g. Henoch-Schönlein purpura) [207-219]. Trauma can also be a cause of acute scrotum due to post-
traumatic haematomas, testicular contusion, rupture, dislocation or torsion [220-225]. Scrotal fat necrosis has 
also been reported to be an uncommon cause of mild-to-moderate scrotal pain in pre-pubertal overweight 
boys after exposure to cold [226].
In this chapter testicular torsion and epididymitis are discussed, while recurrent epididymitis is 
discussed in the chapter dealing with infections. Torsion of the testis occurs most often in the neonatal period 
and around puberty, whereas torsion of the appendix testis occurs over a wider age range [227]. Epididymitis 
affects two age groups: less than one year and twelve to fifteen years [228, 229]. One study predicted the 
annual incidence of epididymitis around 1.2 per 1,000 children [230].
Perinatal torsion of the testis most often occurs prenatally. Bilateral torsion comprises 11-21% of 
all perinatal cases [231]. Most cases of perinatal torsion are extravaginal, in contrast to the usual intravaginal 
torsion which occurs during puberty.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Diagnosis of testicular torsion is based on presentation and physical exam.,-
"Doppler US is an effective imaging tool to evaluate acute scrotum and comparable to scintigraphy and 
dynamic contrast-enhanced subtraction MRI.",2a
Neonates with acute scrotum should be treated as surgical emergencies.,3
