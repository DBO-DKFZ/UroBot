Summary of evidence,LE,,
"Direct vision internal urethrotomy performs poorly in penile strictures. Direct vision internal 
urethrotomy at the penile urethra might provoke venous leakage from the corpora cavernosa with 
subsequent risk of erectile dysfunction.",1b,,
"Increased stricture length is associated with higher risk of failure of direct vision internal urethrotomy 
(DVIU).",1b,,
"In selected patients with a primary, single, short (< 2 cm) and non-obliterative bulbar stricture, a  
five-year stricture-free rate of up to 77% can be expected.",3,,
"Direct vision internal urethrotomy has a stricture-free rate of 51% if performed for a short, veil-like 
recurrent stricture after prior bulbar urethroplasty.",3,,
"There is conflicting evidence that “hot knife” (laser, plasmakinetic) DVIU would be superior compared 
to “cold knife” DVIU after more than one year of follow-up.",1a,,
