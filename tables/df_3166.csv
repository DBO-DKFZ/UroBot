"3.7.2	
Male breast cancer
In vitro and in vivo studies have clearly documented that breast cancer growth is significantly influenced by 
testosterone and/or by its conversion to E2 through different mechanisms and pathways [143]. Accordingly, 
the use of SERMs still represents an important therapeutic option in the management of this cancer [143]. 
No information is available on the role of testosterone therapy in patients successfully treated for male breast 
cancer; therefore, treated and active male breast cancer should be recognised as absolute contraindications 
for testosterone therapy.",
Summary of evidence,LE
Testosterone therapy is contraindicated in men with secondary hypogonadism who desire fertility.,1a
"Testosterone therapy is contraindicated in men with active prostate cancer or breast cancer, as these 
patients are usually excluded from RCTs.",1a
"Testosterone therapy does not increase the risk of prostate cancer, but long-term prospective follow-
up data are required to validate this statement.",1a
"The effect of testosterone therapy in men with severe lower-urinary tract symptoms is limited, as these 
patients are usually excluded from RCTs.",1a
"There is no substantive evidence that testosterone therapy, when replaced to normal levels, results in 
the development of major adverse cardiovascular events.",1a
"There is no evidence of a relationship between testosterone therapy and mild, moderate or CPAP-
treated severe sleep apnoea.",1b
