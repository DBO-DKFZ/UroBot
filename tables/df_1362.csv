"5.3.5.2	
Intra-prostatic injections
Mechanism of action: Various substances have been injected directly into the prostate in order to improve 
LUTS including Botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A), fexapotide triflutate (NX-1207) and PRX302. The primary 
mechanism of action of BoNT-A is through the inhibition of neurotransmitter release from cholinergic neurons 
[525]. The mechanisms of action for the injectables NX-1207 and PRX302 are not completely understood, but 
experimental data suggest apoptosis-induced atrophy of the prostate with both drugs [525].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Results from clinical trials have shown no clinical benefits for BoNT-A compared to placebo for the 
management of LUTS due to BPO.",1a
"Results from clinical trials have shown clinical benefits for NX-1207 compared to placebo for the
