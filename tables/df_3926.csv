"3.4.8.2	
Antithrombotic therapy and stone treatment
Patients with a bleeding disorder, or receiving antithrombotic therapy, should be referred to an internist for 
appropriate therapeutic measures before deciding on stone management [331-335]. In patients with an 
uncorrected bleeding disorder, the following are at elevated risk of haemorrhage or perinephric haematoma 
(PNH) (high-risk procedures):
•	
SWL (hazard ratio of PNH up to 4.2 during anti-coagulant/anti-platelet medication [336-338]);
•	
PNL;
•	
percutaneous nephrostomy;
•	
laparoscopic surgery;
•	
open surgery [331].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Perform pre-procedural imaging, including contrast medium where possible or retrograde 
study when starting the procedure, to assess stone comprehensiveness and anatomy of the 
collecting system to ensure safe access to the renal stone.",Strong
"Perform a tubeless (without nephrostomy tube) or totally tubeless (without nephrostomy 
tube and ureteral stent) percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) procedure, in uncomplicated 
cases.",Strong
"Take a stone culture or urine culture directly from the renal pelvis at time of PNL, if possible.",Strong
