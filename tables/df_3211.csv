Summary of evidence recommendations for cryptorchidism",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Advise men with testicular microcalcification (TM) to perform self-examination even without 
additional risk factors, as this may result in early detection of testicular germ cell tumour 
(TGCT).",Weak
"Do not perform testicular biopsy, follow-up scrotal ultrasound (US), measure biochemical 
tumour markers, or abdominal or pelvic computed tomography, in men with isolated 
TM without associated risk factors (e.g., infertility, cryptorchidism, testicular cancer, and 
atrophic testis).",Strong
"Testicular biopsy may be offered to infertile men with TM, who belong to one of the 
following higher risk groups: spermatogenic failure (infertility), bilateral TM, atrophic testes 
(< 12 mL), history of undescended testes and TGCT.",Weak
"Perform inguinal surgical exploration with testicular biopsy or offer orchidectomy after multi-
disciplinary meeting and discussion with the patient, if there are suspicious findings on 
physical examination or US in patients with TM with associated lesions",Strong
"Manage men treated for TGCT in a multi-disciplinary team setting with a dedicated 
late-effects clinic since they are at increased risk of developing hypogonadism, sexual 
dysfunction and cardiovascular risk.",Weak
"Perform sperm cryopreservation prior to planned orchidectomy or before additional 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant oncological therapies, since men with testis cancer may have 
significant semen abnormalities (including azoospermia).",Weak
"Offer onco-testicular sperm extraction (onco-TESE) at the time of radical orchidectomy 
to men with testicular cancer and azoospermia or severe abnormalities in their semen 
parameters.",Weak
