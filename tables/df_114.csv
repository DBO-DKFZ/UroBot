Primary tumour,
"Perform a detailed physical examination of the penis and external genitalia, recording 
morphology, size and location of the penile lesion, including extent and invasion of penile 
(adjacent) structures.",Strong
"Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the penis/primary tumour (artificial erection 
not mandatory) when there is uncertainty regarding corporal invasion and/or the feasibility 
of (organ-sparing) surgery. If MRI is not available, offer ultrasound (US) as alternative option.",Weak
"Obtain a pre-treatment biopsy of the primary lesion when malignancy is not clinically 
obvious, or when non-surgical treatment of the primary lesion is planned (e.g., topical 
agents, laser, radiotherapy).",Strong
Inguinal lymph nodes (LN),
"Perform a physical examination of both groins. Record the number, laterality and 
Strong
characteristics of any palpable/suspicious inguinal nodes.",
Clinically node-negative (cN0),
"If there are no palpable/suspicious nodes (cN0) at physical examination, offer surgical LN 
staging to all patients at high risk of having micro-metastatic disease (T1b or higher).",Strong
"In case of T1a G2 disease, also discuss surveillance as an alternative to surgical staging 
with patients willing to comply with strict follow-up.",Weak
"When surgical staging is indicated, offer dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB). If DSNB 
is not available and referral is not feasible, or if preferred by the patient after being well 
informed, offer inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) (open or video-endoscopic).",Strong
"If DSNB is planned, perform inguinal US first, with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of 
sonographically abnormal LNs.",Strong
Clinically node-positive (cN+),
"If there is a palpable/suspicious node at physical examination (cN+), obtain (image-guided) 
biopsy to confirm nodal metastasis before initiating treatment.",Strong
"In cN+ patients, stage the pelvis and exclude distant metastases with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-
D-glucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) computed tomography (CT) or CT of 
the chest and abdomen before initiating treatment.",Strong
