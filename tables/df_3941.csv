Specific treatment
General preventive measures are recommended for fluid intake and diet. Hyperoxaluric stone formers should 
consume foods with low oxalate content, whereas hyperuricosuric stone formers benefit from daily dietary 
reduction of purine. Figure 4.3 summarises the pharmacological treatment of calcium oxalate stones [597, 604, 
627-630, 633, 634, 636, 640, 643-645, 649-656, 664, 666-669]. There is only low-level evidence for the efficacy 
of preventing stone recurrence based on pre-treatment stone composition examination and biochemistry 
measures, or on-treatment biochemistry measures [597].",
