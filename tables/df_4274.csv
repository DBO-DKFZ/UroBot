Complications
Early (< 1 month) complications include bleeding, infection, perinephric abscess, sepsis, urinary fistula, 
hypertension, urinary extravasation, and urinoma. Delayed complications include bleeding, calculus formation, 
chronic pyelonephritis, hypertension, AVF
, hydronephrosis and pseudo-aneurysms. Bleeding may be life-
threatening with elective angiographic embolisation the preferred treatment [122]. Perinephric abscess 
formation is initially managed by percutaneous drainage [106].
Hypertension is rare [123, 124]. It may occur acutely because of external compression from peri-
renal haematoma (Page kidney), chronically due to compressive scar formation, or as a result of renal artery 
thrombosis, segmental arterial thrombosis, renal artery stenosis (Goldblatt kidney), or AVF
. Arteriography may 
be required. Treatment, including medical management, excision of the ischaemic parenchymal segment, 
vascular reconstruction, or nephrectomy, is indicated if hypertension persists [121].
Arteriovenous fistulae usually present with delayed onset of significant haematuria, most often after 
penetrating trauma. Percutaneous embolisation is often effective for symptomatic AVF
, but larger fistulae may 
require surgery [125]. The development of pseudo-aneurysm is a rare complication following blunt trauma.",
"Recommendations 
Strength rating",
Evaluation,
Assess haemodynamic stability upon admission.,Strong
"Record past renal surgery, and known pre-existing renal abnormalities (ureteropelvic 
junction obstruction, solitary kidney, urolithiasis).",Strong
Test for haematuria in a patient with suspected renal injury.,Strong
"Perform a multiphase computed tomography (CT) scan in trauma patients with:
• 
visible haematuria;
• 
non-visible haematuria and one episode of hypotension;
• 
a history of rapid deceleration injury and/or significant associated injuries;
• 
penetrating trauma;
• 
clinical signs suggesting renal trauma e.g. flank pain, abrasions, fractured ribs, 
abdominal distension and/or a mass and tenderness.",Strong
Management,
"Manage stable patients with blunt renal trauma non-operatively with close monitoring and 
Strong
re-imaging as required.",
"Manage isolated Grade 1-4 stab and low-velocity gunshot wounds in stable patients non-

operatively.",
