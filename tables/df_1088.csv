"4.5.5.1.4	 Use of vaginal pessary
Intravaginal devices such as pessaries aim to relieve voiding symptoms and improve bladder emptying by 
physical correction of the obstruction caused by a POP
. In a prospective study of eighteen women with grade 
three or four cystocoeles and diagnosed with BOO by urodynamics (defined as PdetQmax > 25 cm H2O, Qmax 
< 15 mL/s), normal voiding was noted in seventeen (94%) immediately after placement of a vaginal pessary. 
No other outcomes were available in this series [535]. No long-term data are available on the use of vaginal 
pessary for BOO.",
