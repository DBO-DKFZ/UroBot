"4.5.5.1.4	 Use of vaginal pessary
Intravaginal devices such as pessaries aim to relieve voiding symptoms and improve bladder emptying by 
physical correction of the obstruction caused by a POP
. In a prospective study of eighteen women with grade 
three or four cystocoeles and diagnosed with BOO by urodynamics (defined as PdetQmax > 25 cm H2O, Qmax 
< 15 mL/s), normal voiding was noted in seventeen (94%) immediately after placement of a vaginal pessary. 
No other outcomes were available in this series [535]. No long-term data are available on the use of vaginal 
pessary for BOO.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Pelvic floor muscle relaxation training with biofeedback may result in relaxation of the pelvic muscles 
and external urethra in women with dysfunctional voiding.",3
"There is no available evidence in the published literature on the clinical effect of ES for management of 
female BOO.",NA
"In women with large (grade three or four) cystocoeles causing BOO, placement of a vaginal pessary may 
improve voiding efficiency.",3
Regular CISC after urethrotomy is better than no catheterisation to prevent recurrence of urethral strictures.,1b
A CISC programme in women with voiding dysfunction after TVT has a cure rate of 59%.,3
"Women who use an intraurethral device have lower PVR volume, but most require its removal due to 
complications.",3
"Extracorporeal magnetic stimulation combined with alfuzosin may be more effective than either of 
these therapies alone in women with functional BOO.",2a
