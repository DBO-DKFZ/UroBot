"3.1.5	
Surgical approaches for first, second, third and further transplants
Transplant (bench/back-table) preparation is a crucial step in the transplantation process. The kidney must 
be inspected whilst on a sterile ice slush, removing peri-nephric fat when possible to permit inspection of the 
quality of the organ and to exclude exophytic renal tumours. Biopsy of the kidney on the back-table may be 
performed to help in the multifactorial decision-making process regarding the quality and usage of the kidney 
for both single and/or dual transplantation. Suspicious parenchymal lesions also require biopsy. Techniques for 
intra-operative kidney biopsy are discussed in section 3.1.3.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"A small (n=51) prospective RCT found that use of Ringer’s lactate solution was associated with 
less hyperkalaemia and acidosis compared with normal saline in patients undergoing kidney 
transplantation.",1b
"A small (n=40) prospective RCT comparing constant infusion vs. CVP found that CVP produced a 
more stable haemodynamic profile, better diuresis and early graft function.",1b
