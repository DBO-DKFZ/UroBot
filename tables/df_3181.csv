implantation with or without additional straightening manoeuvres is the technique of choice.",2a
"In other cases, factors such as penile length, rigidity of erection, degree of curvature, presence of 
complex deformities and patient choice must be taken into account to decide on a tunical shortening 
or lengthening technique.",3
