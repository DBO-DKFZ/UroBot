Female sexuality
The most relevant publications on neurogenic female sexual dysfunction are in women with SCI and MS. After 
SCI, about 65-80% of women continue to be sexually active, but to a much lesser extent than before the injury, 
and about 25% report a decreased satisfaction with their sexual life [476-478]. Although sexual dysfunction is 
very common in women with MS, it is still often overlooked by medical professionals [479, 480]. A vast majority 
of female SB patients considered information about sexuality from their physicians insufficient [481]. Women 
with SCI reported dissatisfaction with the quality and quantity of sexuality-related rehabilitation services and 
were less likely to receive sexual information than men [482-484].",
