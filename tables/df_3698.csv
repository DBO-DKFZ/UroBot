"6.3.2.3.4	 Risk factors for adverse outcomes
In four series specifically dedicated to risk factors for failure after urethroplasty using multivariate analysis, there 
is conflicting evidence about several factors (aetiology, comorbidity, stricture length, prior therapy) that might 
be predictive for failure after urethroplasty (Table 6.6). Advanced age does not appear to be a risk factor for 
urethroplasty failure in the majority of studies, with the exception of Viers et al., 2017 [347] retrospective case 
series which found that the risk for recurrence was significantly higher beyond the age of 60 (< 50 yrs 94%, 
 
> 70 yrs 74%) in 184 patients having a wide variety of urethroplasties. Previous radiation therapy was also 
found to be a risk factor for stricture recurrence in both Viers’ [347] retrospective case series and Ahyai’s 
2015 series [348]  – with only a 71% patency rate at a median follow-up of 29 months in those with previous 
radiotherapy. Based on these data, a clear and evidence-based recommendation cannot be formulated.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Staged urethroplasty for bulbar strictures and for strictures involving the bulbar urethra yields patency 
rates of 33.3-90% depending upon patient and stricture characteristics and patient satisfaction is high 
with all types of staged urethroplasty.",3
"Lichen sclerosus is a relative contraindication for staged urethroplasty in the literature with lower 
long-term urethral patency rates of 52.2% compared to urethral patency rates of 64.3% in non-lichen 
sclerosis patients.",3
Up to 45.5% of men elect not to proceed to 2nd stage re-tubularisation after successful 1st stage.,3
Up to 19% of men required revision of their 1st stage urethroplasty.,3
