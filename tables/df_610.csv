Urinary tract infection in neuro-urological patients
3.5.1	
Epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology
Urinary tract infection is the onset of signs and/or symptoms accompanied by laboratory findings of a UTI 
(bacteriuria, leukocyturia and positive urine culture) [374]. There are no evidence-based cut-off values for the 
quantification of these findings. The published consensus is that a significant bacteriuria in persons performing 
IC is present with > 102 cfu/mL, > 104 cfu/mL in clean-void specimens and any detectable concentration 
in suprapubic aspirates. Regarding leukocyturia, ten or more leukocytes in centrifuged urine samples per 
microscopic field (400x) are regarded as significant [374].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria results in significantly more resistant bacterial strains without 
improving patient outcome.",1a
"Low-dose, long-term, antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce UTI frequency, but increases bacterial 
resistance.",2a
"Recurrent UTIs in patients with neuro-urological disorders may indicate suboptimal management of 
the underlying functional problem. Improvement of bladder function as early as possible is mandatory.",3
"There is currently no preventive measure for recurrent UTI in patients with neuro-urological disorders 
that can be recommended without limitations.",3
