Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,,,
Do not prescribe adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to pN0 patients.,Strong,,,,,,,
"In pN0 patients with ISUP grade group 4–5 and pT3 ± positive margins, offer adjuvant 
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plus 
image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT).",Strong,,,,,,,
"In pN1 patients, after an extended lymph node dissection, discuss three management 
options, based on nodal involvement characteristics:
1. Offer adjuvant ADT;
2. Offer adjuvant ADT with additional IMRT/VMAT plus IGRT;
3.  Offer observation (expectant management) to a patient after eLND and < 2 nodes and a 
PSA < 0.1 ng/mL.",Weak,,,,,,,
