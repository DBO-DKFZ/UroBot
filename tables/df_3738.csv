Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,
"Female urethral stricture symptoms are long standing and non-specific, the most commonly reported 
are frequency, urgency, poor flow, incomplete emptying, and urinary incontinence. It is important to 
exclude FUS in female patients with LUTS.",3,,,,,
"Urethral dilatation alone to 24-41 Fr provides low stricture-free rates of mean 40.1% at mean follow-
up 36 (12-59) months.",3,,,,,
"Isolated repeat dilatation yields patency rates of 26.6%. However, urethral dilatation followed by  ISD 
or regular planned dilatation, as palliation, provides patencyrates of 97% at mean FU 6-21 months.",3,,,,,
"Urethroplasty provides patency rates of 62.5-100%.  VOBMG and DOBMG reported patency rates are 
92-100% and 62.5-100%, respectively.",3,,,,,
"Meatotomy/meatoplasty for short meatal strictures has a success rate of 97% at twelve months 
follow-up.",3,,,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,,,
"Perform flow rate, post-void residual and voiding cystourethrogram or video-urodynamics in 
all women with refractory lower urinary tract symptoms.",Strong,,,,,
Perform urethral dilatation to 24-41 Fr as initial treatment of female urethral stricture (FUS).,Weak,,,,,
"Perform repeat urethral dilatation and start planned weekly intermittent self-dilatation (ISD) 
with a 16-18 Fr catheter for the 1st recurrence of FUS, or plan repeat dilatation.",Weak,,,,,
"Perform urethroplasty in women with a 2nd recurrence of FUS and who cannot perform ISD 
or wish definitive treatment. The technique for urethroplasty should  be determined by the 
surgeon’s experience, availability and quality of graft/flap material and quality of the ventral 
versus dorsal urethra.",Strong,,,,,
Treat meatal strictures by meatotomy/meatoplasty.,Weak,,,,,
