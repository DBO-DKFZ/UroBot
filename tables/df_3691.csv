Anastomotic urethroplasty in men with penile urethral strictures
Historically, the use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been 
discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively [263, 284]. Nevertheless, it has been performed in 
selected patients with very short strictures (usually < 1 cm) with 80-93% patency rate, with satisfactory QoL 
and sexual function and without any case of chordee [285] and with results comparable to augmentation 
urethroplasty [286].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Men with failed hypospadias repair (FHR) have history of multiple interventions, and poor-quality 
tissues, and might require complex procedures for a satisfactory functional and cosmetic outcome.",4
"Men with FHR may have low self-esteem due to urinary and sexual dysfunction and unsatisfactory 
cosmesis.",2b
"Men with FHR can have scarred penile skin or concurrent lichen sclerosus and outcomes with skin 
grafts or flaps can be unsatisfactory.",3
