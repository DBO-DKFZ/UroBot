"5.6.5.2.3	 Autologous slings
The strategy of intra-operative placement of an autologous vas deferens sling below the vesico-urethral 
anastomosis during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has been explored with the intention to 
improve early return of continence. Two RCTs [653, 654] showed an advantage of sling vs. no sling at one-
month follow-up, and another study [655] showed an advantage of a 6-branch vs. a 2-branch sling at one 
month follow-up. However, a larger RCT (n=195), showed that continence rate and near-continence rate were 
similar between groups at six months with 66% vs. 65% and 86% vs. 88%, respectively [656].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer non-adjustable transobturator slings to men with mild-to-moderate* post-
prostatectomy incontinence.",Weak
"Inform men that severe incontinence, prior pelvic radiotherapy or transurethral surgery may 
worsen the outcome of non-adjustable male sling surgery.",Weak
