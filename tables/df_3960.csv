an asymptomatic calyceal stone.",4
"The temporary discontinuation, or bridging of antithrombotic therapy in high-risk patients, should be 
discussed with the internist.",3

patients, in consultation with the internist.",Strong
"Retrograde (flexible) ureteroscopy is the preferred intervention if stone removal is essential
