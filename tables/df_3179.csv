8.2.3.1.5	 Summary of evidence for conservative treatment of Peyronie’s disease,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Conservative treatment for PD is primarily aimed at treating patients in the early stage of the disease in 
order to relieve symptoms and prevent progression.",3c
"There is no convincing evidence supporting oral treatment with acetyl esters of carnitine, vitamin E, 
potassium para-aminobenzoate (potaba) and pentoxifylline.",3c
"Due to adverse effects, treatment with oral tamoxifen is no longer recommended.",3c
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used to treat pain in the acute phase.,4
"Intralesional treatment with calcium channel antagonists: verapamil and nicardipine are no longer 
recommended due to contradictory results.",1b
"Intralesional treatment with Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum showed significant decreases in 
penile curvature, plaque diameter and plaque length in men with stable disease.",1b
"Intralesional treatment with interferon may improve penile curvature, plaque size and density, and pain.",2b
"Intralesional treatment with steroids are no longer recommended due to adverse effects, including 
tissue atrophy, thinning of the skin and immunosuppression.",3c
No robust evidence is available to support treatment with intralesional hyaluronic acid or botulinum toxin.,3c
"Intralesional hyaluronic acid may be used to improve pain, penile curvature and IIEF scores.",2b
"Combination of oral and intralesional hyaluronic acid treatment improves penile curvature and plaque 
size.",1b
"There is no evidence that topical treatments applied to the penile shaft result in adequate levels of the 
active compound within the tunica albuginea.",3c
The use of iontophoresis is not recommended due to the absence of efficacy data.,3c
"Extracorporeal shockwave treatment may be offered to treat penile pain, but it does not improve 
penile curvature and plaque size.",2b
"Treatment with penile traction therapy alone or in combination with injectable therapy as part of a 
multimodal approach may reduce penile curvature and increase penile length, although studies have 
limitations.",3c
