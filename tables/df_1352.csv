"5.3.2.4	
Thulium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser enucleation of the prostate
Mechanism of action: The Tm:YAG laser has been described in section 5.3.1.3. Enucleation using the Tm:YAG 
laser includes thulium vapoenucleation of the prostate (ThuVEP) and thulium Laser enucleation of the prostate 
(ThuLEP) (blunt enucleation).",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Enucleation of the prostate using the Tm:YAG laser demonstrates similar efficacy when compared to 
M-TURP/bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation, HoLEP and B-TURP in the short-, mid-, and 
long-term, respectively.",1b
"Enucleation of the prostate using the Tm:YAG laser (ThuLEP) demonstrates similar safety compared 
to TURP/bipolar transurethral (plasmakinetic) enucleation, and HoLEP in the short- and mid-term, 
respectively.",1b
"Vapoenucleation of the prostate using a Tm:YAG laser (ThuVEP) seems to be safe in patients with 
large prostates and those receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.",2b
