Summary of evidence and recommendations for the diagnostic assessment of RCC",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Contrast-enhanced multi-phasic CT has a high sensitivity and specificity for characterisation and 
detection of RCC, invasion, tumour thrombus and mRCC.",2a
"Magnetic resonance imaging has a slightly higher sensitivity and specificity for small cystic renal 
masses and tumour thrombi as compared to CT.",2a
Contrast-enhanced US has a high sensitivity and specificity for characterisation of renal masses.,2a
"Renal mass biopsies are associated with reduced overtreatment of benign masses and offers patients 
additional information (i.e. grade, subtype) for an informed decision regarding optimal management.",3
"Ultrasound, power-Doppler US and positron-emission tomography CT have a low sensitivity and 
specificity for detection and characterisation of RCC.",2a
