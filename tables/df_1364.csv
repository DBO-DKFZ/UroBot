Intra-prostatic injections
Mechanism of action: Various substances have been injected directly into the prostate in order to improve 
LUTS including Botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A), fexapotide triflutate (NX-1207) and PRX302. The primary 
mechanism of action of BoNT-A is through the inhibition of neurotransmitter release from cholinergic neurons 
[525]. The mechanisms of action for the injectables NX-1207 and PRX302 are not completely understood, but 
experimental data suggest apoptosis-induced atrophy of the prostate with both drugs [525].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Treat underlying causes of nocturia, including behavioural, systemic condition(s), sleep 
disorders, lower urinary tract dysfunction, or a combination of factors.",Weak
"Discuss behavioural changes with the patient to reduce nocturnal urine volume and 
episodes of nocturia and improve sleep quality.",Weak
Offer desmopressin to decrease nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in men < 65 years of age.  Weak,
"Offer low dose desmopressin for men > 65 years of age with nocturia at least twice per 
night due to nocturnal polyuria.",Weak
"Screen for hyponatremia at baseline, day three and day seven, one month after initiating 
therapy and periodically during treatment. Measure serum sodium more frequently in 
patients > 65 years of age and in patients at increased risk of hyponatremia.",Strong
"Discuss with the patient the potential clinical benefit relative to the associated risks from 
the use of desmopressin, especially in men > 65 years of age.",Strong
"Offer α1-adrenergic antagonists for treating nocturia in men who have nocturia associated 
with LUTS.",Weak
"Offer antimuscarinic drugs for treating nocturia in men who have nocturia associated with 
overactive bladder.",Weak
"Offer 5α-reductase inhibitors for treating nocturia in men who have nocturia associated with 
LUTS and an enlarged prostate (> 40 mL).",Weak
Do not offer phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for the treatment of nocturia.,Weak
