Adjuvant chemotherapy 
There are known poor prognostic characteristics for a subset of patients with resected high-risk disease (such 
as involved pelvic LNs), indicating the likely presence of micrometastatic disease. Data exists on response 
rates for those with metastatic disease and there is possible benefit for pre-operative chemotherapy for those 
with unresectable locally advanced disease as described above. With extrapolation from other diseases, it 
stands to reason that systemic therapy following resection (i.e., adjuvant therapy) may improve outcomes.",
