"11.5.2.1.4	 Alcohol consumption 
Data derived from a recent meta-analysis including 15 cross-sectional studies and 16,395 men suggested 
that moderate alcohol does not adversely affect semen parameters, whereas high alcohol intake can have a 
detrimental effect on male fertility [2114]. Similar to what has been reported for weight loss; however, heavy 
chronic alcohol consumption (defined as > 2 drinks/day [2115]) can reduce testosterone levels, which can be 
restored by alcohol cessation [2116].",

"Treat hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (secondary hypogonadism), including congenital 
causes, with combined human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and follicle-stimulating 
hormone (FSH) (recombinant FSH; highly purified FSH) or pulsed Gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) via pump therapy to stimulate spermatogenesis.",Strong
"Induce spermatogenesis by an effective drug therapy (hCG; human menopausal 
gonadotropins; recombinant FSH; highly purified FSH) in men with hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism.",Strong
"The use of GnRH therapy is more expensive and does not offer any advantages when 
compared to gonadotropins for the treatment of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",Strong
"Use FSH treatment in men with idiopathic oligozoospermia and FSH values within the 
normal range, to ameliorate spermatogenesis outcomes.",Weak
"No conclusive recommendations can be given on the use of high-dose FSH in men with 
idiopathic infertility and prior (m)TESE and therefore cannot be routinely advocated.",Weak
Do not use testosterone therapy for the treatment of male infertility.,Strong
"Provide testosterone therapy for symptomatic patients with primary and secondary 
hypogonadism who are not considering parenthood.",Strong
"In the presence of hyperprolactinaemia, dopamine agonist therapy may improve 
spermatogenesis.",Weak
