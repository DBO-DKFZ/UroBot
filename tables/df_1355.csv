Diode laser enucleation of the prostate
Mechanism of action: For prostate surgery, diode lasers with a wavelength of 940, 980, 1,318, and 1,470 nm 
(depending on the semiconductor used) are marketed for vaporisation and enucleation. Only a few have been 
evaluated in clinical trials [385].",
Summary of evidence,LE
Bipolar-TUVP and TURP have similar short-term efficacy.,1a
"Plasmakinetic B-TUVP has a favourable peri-operative profile, similar mid-term safety but inferior mid-
term efficacy compared to TURP.",1a
Plasma B-TUVP has a lower short-term major morbidity rate compared to TURP.,1a
