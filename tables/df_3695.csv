Anastomotic urethroplasty in men with penile urethral strictures
Historically, the use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been 
discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively [263, 284]. Nevertheless, it has been performed in 
selected patients with very short strictures (usually < 1 cm) with 80-93% patency rate, with satisfactory QoL 
and sexual function and without any case of chordee [285] and with results comparable to augmentation 
urethroplasty [286].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Use transecting excision and primary anastomosis (tEPA) for short posttraumatic bulbar 
strictures with (nearly) complete obliteration of the lumen and full thickness spongiofibrosis.",Strong
"Use non-transecting excision and primary anastomosis or free graft urethroplasty instead of 
tEPA for short bulbar strictures not related to straddle injury.",Weak
