"3.4.10.4.2	 Stones in the lower renal pole
The stone clearance rate after SWL seems to be lower for stones in the inferior calyx than for other intra-renal 
locations. Although the disintegration efficacy of SWL is not limited compared to other locations, the fragments 
often remain in the calyx and cause recurrent stone formation. The reported SFR of SWL for lower pole calculi 
is 25-95%. The preferential use of endoscopic procedures is supported by some current reports, even for 
stones < 1 cm [204, 382, 383, 385, 389, 393, 395-407].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"It is still debatable whether renal stones should be treated, or whether annual follow-up is sufficient for 
asymptomatic calyceal stones that have remained stable for six months.",4
"Although the question of whether asymptomatic calyceal stones should be treated is still unanswered, 
stone growth, de novo obstruction, associated infection, and acute and/or chronic pain are indications 
for treatment.",3
Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is indicated in renal stones > 2 cm as primary option.,1a
