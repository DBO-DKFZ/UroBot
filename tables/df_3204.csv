"10.2.1.4.8	 Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors
Low doses of PDE5Is have a paradoxical effect in alleviating and preventing stuttering priapism; mainly in 
patients with idiopathic and SCD-associated priapism [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694-1698] (LE: 3). It is important to 
remember that therapy should be started when the penis is in its flaccid state and not during an acute episode. 
There is a delay of one week before treatment is effective. There are no reported impairments in male sexual 
function (LE: 3). Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor treatment of stuttering priapism is possibly mediated by 
an increase in the concentration of cGMP in the smooth muscle in an NO dysfunctional state. This can occur 
in priapism and may result in a change in the NO pathway, with down-regulation of cavernosal PDE5 thereby 
preventing the complete degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum [1573, 1607, 1668, 1694].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Take a comprehensive history to establish the diagnosis, which can help to determine the 
priapism subtype.",Strong
"Include a physical examination of the genitalia, perineum and abdomen in the diagnostic 
evaluation.",Strong
Include a neurological examination if neurogenic non-ischaemic priapism is suspected.,Strong
"For laboratory testing, include complete blood count, with white blood cell differential, and 
coagulation profile.",Strong
"Analyse the blood gas parameters from blood aspirated from the penis to differentiate 
between ischaemic and non-ischaemic priapism.",Strong
