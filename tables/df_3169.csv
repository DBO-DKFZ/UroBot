Male breast cancer
In vitro and in vivo studies have clearly documented that breast cancer growth is significantly influenced by 
testosterone and/or by its conversion to E2 through different mechanisms and pathways [143]. Accordingly, 
the use of SERMs still represents an important therapeutic option in the management of this cancer [143]. 
No information is available on the role of testosterone therapy in patients successfully treated for male breast 
cancer; therefore, treated and active male breast cancer should be recognised as absolute contraindications 
for testosterone therapy.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Assess all patients for inadequate/incorrect information about the mechanism of action and 
the ways in which drugs should be taken, as they are the main causes of a lack of response 
to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is).",Weak
"Use cognitive behaviour therapy as a psychological approach (include the partner) 
combined with medical treatment to maximise treatment outcomes.",Strong
"Initiate lifestyle changes and risk factor modification prior to, or at the same time as, 
initiating erectile dysfunction (ED) treatments.",Strong
"Treat a curable cause of ED first, when found.",Weak
Use PDE5Is as first-line therapeutic option.,Strong
"Use topical/intra-urethral alprostadil as an alternative first-line therapy in well-informed 
patients who do not wish or are not suitable for oral vasoactive therapy.",Weak
"Use topical/intra-urethral alprostadil as an alternative first-line therapy, in well-informed 
patients, who do not wish to have intracavernous injections or in patients who prefer a  
less-invasive therapy.",Weak
"Use intracavernous injections as an alternative first-line therapy in well-informed patients or 
as second-line therapy.",Strong
"Use low intensity shockwave treatment (LI-SWT) with/without PDE5Is in patients with mild 
vasculogenic ED or as an alternative first-line therapy in well-informed patients who do not 
wish or are not suitable for oral vasoactive therapy or desire a curable option.",Weak
"Use LI-SWT with/without PDE5Is in vasculogenic ED patients who are poor responders to 
PDE5Is.",Weak
"Use vacuum erection devices as an alternative first-line therapy in well-informed patients 
with infrequent sexual intercourse and in patients with comorbidities requiring non-invasive, 
drug-free management of ED.",Weak
Do not use platelet-rich plasma to treat ED outside the confines of a clinical trial.,Weak
"Use implantation of a penile prosthesis if other treatments fail or depending upon patient 
preference.",Strong
"Discuss with patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (any technique) about the risk of 
sexual changes other than ED, including libido reduction, changes in orgasm, anejaculation, 
Peyronie’s like disease and penile size changes.",Strong
"Start pro-erectile treatments at the earliest opportunity after radical prostatectomy/pelvic 
surgery and other curative treatments for prostate cancer.",Weak
"Data is inadequate to support the use of any specific regimen for penile rehabilitation after 
radical prostatectomy.",Strong
