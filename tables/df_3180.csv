Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer conservative treatment to patients not fit for surgery or when surgery is not acceptable 
to the patient.",Strong
"Fully counsel patients regarding all available treatment options and outcomes before 
starting any treatment.",Strong
"Do not offer oral treatment with vitamin E, potassium para-aminobenzoate (potaba), 
tamoxifen, pentoxifylline, colchicine and acetyl esters of carnitine to treat Peyronie’s disease 
(PD).",Strong
Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to treat penile pain in the acute phase of PD.,Strong
"Use extracorporeal shockwave treatment (ESWT) to treat penile pain in the acute phase of 
PD.",Weak
"Use phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors to treat concomitant erectile dysfunction or if the 
deformity results in difficulty in penetrative intercourse in order to optimise penetration.",Weak
"Offer intralesional therapy with interferon alpha-2b to patients with stable curvature dorsal 
or lateral > 30o seeking a minimal invasive procedure.",Strong
"Offer intralesional therapy with Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum to patients with stable 
PD and dorsal or lateral curvature > 30o, who request non-surgical treatment, although the 
placebo effects are high.",Strong
"Do not offer intralesional treatment with steroids to reduce penile curvature, plaque size or 
pain.",Strong
"Do not use intralesional platelet-rich plasma or hyaluronic acid, either alone or in 
combination with oral treatment, to reduce penile curvature, plaque size or pain outside the 
confines of a clinical trial.",Weak
Do not offer ESWT to improve penile curvature and reduce plaque size.,Strong
"Offer penile traction devices and vacuum devices to reduce penile deformity or as part of a 
multimodal therapy approach, although outcome data is limited.",Weak
