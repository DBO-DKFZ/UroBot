Anastomotic urethroplasty in men with penile urethral strictures
Historically, the use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been 
discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively [263, 284]. Nevertheless, it has been performed in 
selected patients with very short strictures (usually < 1 cm) with 80-93% patency rate, with satisfactory QoL 
and sexual function and without any case of chordee [285] and with results comparable to augmentation 
urethroplasty [286].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Stricture-free rates for single-stage penile augmentation urethroplasties range from 70%-100% for 
dorsal OMG augmentation, 67-100% for penile skin flap (PSF) augmentation, 55-92.6% for ventral 
OMG augmentation and 62-78% for dorsal SG augmentation. Overall stricture-free rates for staged 
OMG penile augmentation urethroplasties range from 70-100%.",2b
"In staged urethroplasties, an interval of at least four to six months has been proposed before 
proceeding to the tubularisation of the urethra, provided that the graft has healed uneventfully.",4
"The use of anastomotic urethroplasty in the management of urethral stricture disease has been 
discouraged due to the risk of chordee post-operatively. Anastomotic urethroplasty can be offered in 
selected cases of very short (< 1 cm), injury-associated penile strictures.",3
"In case of adverse intra-operative findings, a single-stage approach might not be feasible and must be 
converted into a staged approach.",3
