Disease management
Before commencing any treatment, it is essential to define the subtype of PE and discuss patient’s 
expectations thoroughly. Pharmacotherapy must be considered the first-line treatment for patients with lifelong 
PE, whereas treating the underlying cause (e.g., ED, prostatitis, LUTS, anxiety and hyperthyroidism) must be 
the initial goal for patients with acquired PE [228]. Various behavioural techniques may be beneficial in treating 
variable and subjective PE [770]. Psychotherapy can also be considered for PE patients who are uncomfortable 
with pharmacological therapy or in combination with pharmacological therapy [771, 772]. However, there is 
weak and inconsistent evidence regarding the effectiveness of these psychosexual interventions and their long-
term outcomes in PE are unknown [773].",
