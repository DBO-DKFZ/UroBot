Summary of evidence,LE
No contemporary data exists to support that pre-operative RT for operable MIBC increases survival.,2a
"Pre-operative RT for operable MIBC, using a dose of 45–50 Gy in fractions of 1.8–2 Gy, results in 
down-staging after 4 to 6 weeks.",2
"Limited evidence supports the safe use of pre- and post-operative RT in case a neobladder is planned 
or in situ.",3
"Limited high-quality evidence supports the use of pre-operative RT to decrease local recurrence of 
MIBC after RC.",3
"Addition of adjuvant RT to chemotherapy is associated with an improvement in local relapse-free 
survival following cystectomy for locally-advanced bladder cancer (pT3b–4, or node-positive).",2a
