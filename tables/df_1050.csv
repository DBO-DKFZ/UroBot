"4.1.4.2.4	 Oestrogens
Oestrogen treatment for UI has been tested using oral, transdermal, and vaginal routes of administration. 
Vaginal (local) treatment is primarily used to treat symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. 
Available evidence is related mainly to SUI, and although some reviews include participants with UUI, it is 
difficult to generalise the results to women with predominantly OAB/UUI.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"A single treatment session of onabotA (100 U) injected in the bladder wall is more effective than 
placebo at curing and improving UUI/OAB symptoms and improving QoL.",1a
"There is no evidence that repeated injections of onabotA have reduced efficacy, but discontinuation 
rates are high.",2a
"There is a risk of voiding dysfunction, increased PVR volume and UTI with onabotA injections.",1a
"The risk of bacteriuria after onabotA (100 U) injection is high but the clinical significance of this 
remains uncertain.",1b
"OnabotulinumtoxinA is more effective in curing UUI but similarly effective in reducing mean UUI 
episodes compared with antimuscarinics.",1a
OnabotulinumtoxinA is associated with higher rates of voiding dysfunction than antimuscarinics.,1a
