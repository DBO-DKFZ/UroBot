Summary of evidence and guidelines for pre- and post-operative radiotherapy,
Summary of evidence,LE
"Adjuvant radiotherapy results in increased OS if greater than two inguinal LN-positive and PLND-
dissection negative.",2b
"Adjuvant conventional radiotherapy doses are often insufficient for durable control. Increased DSS and 
RFS in penile cancer requires 54 Gy for ENE and 57–60 Gy for positive margins.",3
Peri-operative chemo-radiotherapy,
"1b 
chemo-radiotherapy significantly improves loco-regional control over radiotherapy alone for other SCC 
originating in anal canal or head and neck, whilst in vulvar cancers it improves OS. The evidence is, 
however, sparse in penile cancer.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer adjuvant radiotherapy (with or without chemo sensitisation) to patients with pN2/N3 
disease, including those who received prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",Weak
"Offer definitive radiotherapy (with or without chemo sensitisation) to patients unwilling or 
unable to undergo surgery.",Weak
"Offer radiotherapy (with or without chemo sensitisation) to cN3 patients who are not 
candidates for multi-agent chemotherapy.",Weak
