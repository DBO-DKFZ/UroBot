Guidelines for MRI imaging in biopsy decision",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Literature review including multiple biopsy schemes suggests that a minimum 12-core scheme is 
optimal in the majority of initial and repeat biopsy patients, dependent on prostate size. These biopsy 
schemes should be heavily weighted towards the lateral aspect and the apex of the prostate to 
maximize peripheral zone sampling [299].",3
"Systematic review and meta-analysis comparing MRI-targeted transrectal biopsy to MRI-targeted 
transperineal biopsy, analysing 8 studies, showed a higher sensitivity for detection of csPCa when the 
transperineal approach was used (86% vs. 73%).",2
"Current literature, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, does not show a clear superiority 
of one image-guided technique (cognitive guidance, US/MR fusion software or direct in-bore 
guidance) over the other.",2
