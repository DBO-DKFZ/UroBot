Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after radical prostatectomy,
"Perform prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/
computed tomography (PET/CT) if the PSA level is > 0.2 ng/mL and if the results will 
influence subsequent treatment decisions.",Weak
"In case PSMA PET/CT is not available, and the PSA level is > 1 ng/mL, perform fluciclovine 
PET/CT or choline PET/CT imaging if the results will influence subsequent treatment decisions.",Weak
PSA recurrence after radiotherapy,
"Perform prostate magnetic resonance imaging to localise abnormal areas and guide 
Weak
biopsies in patients fit for local salvage therapy.",
"Perform PSMA PET/CT (if available) or fluciclovine PET/CT or choline PET/CT in patients fit 
Strong
for curative salvage treatment.",
