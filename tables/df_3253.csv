Summary of evidence,LE
"Male genital malformations represent a rare clinical entity with an overall prevalence between 0.9% 
and 2.1%.",3
"Obesity, lichen sclerosis and penile cancer treatment are risk factors for AABP.",4
"Adult acquired buried penis is commonly associated with erectile and voiding dysfunctions, difficulties 
in maintaining adequate genital hygiene and a poor quality of life.",3
"Adult acquired buried penis condition can be staged upon both clinical presentation and the surgical 
procedure required according to available classification systems",3
"Bladder exstrophy–epispadias complex (BEEC) is a rare clinical condition frequently associated with 
male genital malformations, particularly micropenis.",2b
"Penile traumatic or surgical amputation due to penile cancer are the most common acute causes of 
intrinsic penile shortening.",3
"The most frequent aetiologies leading to a chronic intrinsic penile shortening are PD, treatments for 
prostate cancer (RP, radiation therapy and androgen-deprivation therapy) and radical cystectomy.",2b
"Body dysmorphic disorder is a clinical entity associated with a significant distress or impairment in 
important areas of the individual’s life.",2b
"Penile dysmorphic disorder can be used as a shorthand concept to describe BDD patients mainly 
focused on penile size/shape.",4
Body dysmorphic disorder/PDD can be revealed in patients requiring cosmetic surgery.,3
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Perform a detailed genital examination in all men and particularly in men with BMI > 30, 
lichen sclerosis or penile cancer history and complaints of urinary/sexual difficulties or poor 
cosmesis to exclude the presence of an adult acquired buried penis (AABP) condition.",Strong
Use classification systems to classify AABP clinical presentation and surgical management.,Weak
"Inquire on the presence of body dysmorphic disorder/penile dysmorphic disorder in patients 
with normal-sized penis complaining of short penile size.",Strong
