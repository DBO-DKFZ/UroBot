Matching of donors and recipients
Histocompatibility antigens show remarkable polymorphism and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching 
is still very important in kidney transplantation as transplant outcome correlates with the number of HLA 
mismatches [230-233]. Human leukocyte antigen incompatibility can result in proliferation and activation of 
the recipient’s CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells with concomitant activation of B-cell allo-antibody production. This 
may lead to cellular and humoral graft rejection. Matching should concentrate on HLA antigens, which impact 
outcome. Human leukocyte antigens A, B, C as well as DR must be determined in all potential recipients and 
donors according to current guidelines and national allocation rules [230-235]. Additionally, it is recommended 
to determine HLA-DQ antigens of donor and recipient. Furthermore, HLA-DP antigen characterisation may be 
performed, especially for sensitised recipients [230-235].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Surgery (radical prostatectomy) was the most frequently performed treatment for localised PCa after 
kidney transplant.",2b
"Overall oncological outcomes following PCa treatment in kidney transplant recipients were 
comparable to the non-transplanted population.",2b
