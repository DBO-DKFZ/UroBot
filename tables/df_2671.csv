Steroids
Steroids have a large number of side effects [242-244, 295], especially with long-term use. Most practitioners 
still consider steroids (either prednisolone or methylprednisolone) to be a fundamental adjunct to primary 
immunosuppression, even though successful steroid withdrawal has been achieved in the vast majority of 
patients in many prospective, randomised trials [242, 244, 245, 295, 300, 301]. The risk of steroid withdrawal 
depends on the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medication, immunological risk, ethnicity, and 
time after transplantation. Although the risk of rejection diminishes over time, potential benefits may be less 
prominent after a prolonged steroid treatment period [242-245, 295]. Recent studies suggest similar efficacy 
but less diabetes after early steroid withdrawal or steroid minimisation in low-risk patients treated with 
tacrolimus, MPA and induction (either basiliximab or ATG) [302, 303].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Combination therapy with CNIs aggravates CNI-induced nephrotoxicity. Therefore, CNI dosage should 
be substantially reduced in combination therapy with m-TOR inhibitors, which seems to have no 
impact on efficacy, due to the highly synergistic potential of this combination therapy.",1
"Take into consideration impaired wound healing and prophylactic surgical measures when m-TOR 
inhibitors are used as part of the initial immunosuppressive regimen or when patients treated with 
m-TOR inhibitors undergo major surgery.",1
"When combined with CNIs, antimicrobial prophylaxis for P. jirovecii pneumonia should be administered 
for one year following transplantation.",1
"Conversion from CNIs is not advisable in patients with proteinuria > 800 mg/day, and a cautious and 
individual approach should be followed in patients with GFR < 30 mL/min.",1
