Mycophenolates (MPA)
The mycophenolates, MMF and EC-MPS, are based on mycophenolic acid, which inhibits inosine 
monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) [283-287]. This is the rate-limiting step for the synthesis of guanosine 
monophosphate in the de novo purine pathway. As the function and proliferation of lymphocytes is more 
dependent on de novo purine nucleotide synthesis compared to other cell types, IMPDH inhibitors may provide 
more specific lymphocyte-targeted immunosuppression. The co-administration of MPA with prednisolone and 
CNI has resulted in a profound reduction of biopsy-proven rejections [242, 245, 283-287]. Mycophenolic acid is 
not nephrotoxic; however, it inhibits bone marrow function and may cause CMV infections and gastrointestinal 
side effects, particularly diarrhoea [242, 245, 283-287]. There is also a higher incidence of polyoma 
nephropathy, especially when mycophenolate is combined with tacrolimus [288].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"The co-administration of MPA with prednisolone and CNI has resulted in a profound reduction of 
biopsy-proven rejections.",1
"Both MPA formulations, MMF and EC-MPS, are equally effective with an almost identical safety 
profile.",1
"Due to a higher incidence of CMV disease with MPA either CMV prophylaxis or a pre-emptive strategy 
with regular screening for CMV viraemia should be instituted.",1
