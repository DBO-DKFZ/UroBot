Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Bulky inguinal LN enlargement indicates extensive lymphatic metastatic disease for which few patients will 
benefit from surgery alone. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before inguinal LN surgery allows for early treatment of 
systemic disease and down-sizing of the inguinal LN metastases. In responders, complete surgical treatment is 
possible with reasonable clinical outcome.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using a cisplatin- and taxane-based combination 
to chemotherapy-fit patients with pelvic lymph node involvement or those with extensive 
inguinal involvement (cN3), in preference to up front surgery. (see Section 6.4.1).",Weak
Offer surgery to patients responding to NAC in whom resection is feasible.,Strong
"Offer surgery to patients who have not progressed during NAC, but resection is feasible.
