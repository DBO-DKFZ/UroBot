Diagnostic value of lymphadenectomy 
To understand the lymphatic spread in MIBC, two important autopsy studies have been performed. The first 
study analysed 367 patients with a history of cystectomy or MIBC at the time of autopsy. In total, 215 patients 
(59%) had node-positive disease [335]. In these patients 92% of the positive LNs were regional (perivesical or 
pelvic), 72% retroperitoneal and 35% abdominal. 
The second autopsy study focused on the nodal yield when super-extended pelvic LND was 
performed. Substantial inter-individual differences were found with counts ranging from 10 to 53 nodes [336]. 
These findings demonstrate the limited utility of node count as a surrogate for extent of dissection, supporting 
a template-based LND instead.",
