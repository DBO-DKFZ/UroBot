Cystourethroscopy
Cystourethroscopy allows for accurate visual detection of a suspected stricture or can rule out a stricture 
as cause of obstructive voiding [166]. It can detect narrowing of the urethral lumen before changes in 
uroflowmetry and symptoms [145]. Cystourethroscopy can also assess the presence of LS or other pathology 
but cannot usually assess stricture length as the calibre of most cystoscopes is greater than most symptomatic 
strictures [176]. To overcome this, use of smaller calibre ureteroscopes (6.5 Fr and 4.5 Fr) has been reported 
[176]. This also allows an assessment of the bladder prior to surgery and may identify other pathology such as 
bladder stones. Cystourethroscopy is particularly helpful for diagnosing proximal BMS which may be missed 
on RUG [177] .",
Summary of evidence,LE
Cystourethroscopy will reliably detect the presence of a urethral stricture.,3
"Combined retrograde urethroscopy and antegrade cystoscopy is more accurate than retrograde and 
voiding cystourethrography at identifying associated abnormalities such as fistulae, false passages, 
and calculi in patients with PFUI.",3
