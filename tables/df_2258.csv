Guidelines for follow-up during hormonal treatment",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"The follow-up strategy must be individualised based on stage of disease, prior symptoms, 
prognostic factors and the treatment given.",Strong
"In patients with stage M0 disease, schedule follow-up at least every 6 months. As a 
minimum requirement, include a disease-specific history, serum prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) determination, as well as liver and renal function in the diagnostic work-up.",Strong
"In M1 patients, schedule follow-up at least every 3–6 months.",Strong
"In patients on long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), measure initial bone mineral 
density to assess fracture risk.",Strong
"During follow-up of patients receiving ADT, check PSA and testosterone levels and monitor 
patients for symptoms associated with metabolic syndrome as a side effect of ADT.",Strong
"As a minimum requirement, include a disease-specific history, haemoglobin, serum 
creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, lipid profiles and HbA1c level measurements.",Strong
"Counsel patients (especially with M1b status) about the clinical signs suggestive of spinal 
cord compression.",Strong
"When disease progression is suspected, restaging is needed and the subsequent follow-up 
adapted/individualised.",Strong
"In patients with suspected progression, assess the testosterone level. By definition, 
castration-resistant PCa requires a testosterone level < 50 ng/dL (< 1.7 nmol/L).",Strong
