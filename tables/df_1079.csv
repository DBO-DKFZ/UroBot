Mixed urinary incontinence 
The term MUI is broad because it may refer to equal stress and urgency symptoms, stress-predominant 
symptoms, urgency-predominant symptoms, urodynamic stress urinary incontinence (USUI or USI) with DO or 
USUI with clinical urgency symptoms, but no DO [434]. The challenge of this broad definition is that it leads to 
inconsistencies when evaluating treatment options and outcomes.",
