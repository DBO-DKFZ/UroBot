Diagnostic ureteroscopy
Flexible ureteroscopy (URS) is used to confirm the diagnosis of UTUC by visualising the ureter, renal pelvis 
and collecting system and perform a biopsy of suspicious lesions. It is also essential for meticulous tumour 
mapping before considering kidney-sparing options for UTUC. Presence, appearance, multifocality and size of 
the tumour can be determined using URS. In addition, ureteroscopic biopsies can determine tumour grade in 
more than 90% of cases with a low false-negative rate, regardless of sample size [100]. However, undergrading 
occurs with ureteroscopic diagnostic biopsy compared to nephroureterectomy specimens [101], making 
intensive follow-up necessary if kidney-sparing treatment is chosen [75, 102].",
