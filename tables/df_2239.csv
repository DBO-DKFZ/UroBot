Deferred treatment (active surveillance/watchful waiting)
As PCa is such a common disease, and with the increased rate of early detection of small tumours after the 
introduction of PSA, there is a distinct risk of over-diagnosis and subsequent over-treatment of the disease [474]. 
As all available curative treatment options for PCa carry a risk of significant side effects there is a need for 
conservative treatment options for patients with low risk of dying from their PCa. Data from studies conducted 
on patients who did not undergo local treatment with up to 25 years of follow-up, with endpoints of OS and CSS, 
are available. Several series have shown a consistent CSS rate of 82–87% at 10 years [475-478], and 80–95% for 
T1/T2 and ISUP grade < 2 PCas [479]. In three studies with data beyond 15 years, the CSS was 80%, 79% and 
58% respectively [475, 477, 478], and two reported 20-year CSS rates of 57% and 32% [475, 477]. The observed 
heterogeneity in outcomes is due to different inclusion criteria, with some older studies from the pre-PSA era 
showing worse outcomes [477]. In addition, many patients classified as ISUP grade 1 would now be classified as 
ISUP grade 2–3 based on the 2005 Gleason classification, suggesting that the above-mentioned results should 
be considered as minimal. Patients with well-, moderately- and poorly-differentiated tumours had 10-year CSS 
rates of 91%, 90% and 74%, respectively, correlating with data from a pooled analysis [479]. Observation is 
most effective in men aged 65–75 years with low-risk PCa [480]. In screen-detected localised PCa there is also a 
lead-time bias, resulting in a higher rate of early detected PCa, but also an even higher risk of detecting clinically 
insignificant PCa that never would have caused any problems [474]. Cancer-specific survival from untreated 
screen-detected PCa in patients with ISUP grade 1–2 is therefore likely to be even higher than for PCa detected 
of other reasons. Consequently, a high proportion of men with PSA-detected PCa are suitable for conservative 
treatment.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Use individual life expectancy, health status, and co-morbidity in PCa management.",Strong
"Use the Geriatric-8, mini-COG and Clinical Frailty Scale tools for health status screening.",Strong
Perform a full specialist geriatric evaluation in patients with a G8 score < 14.,Strong
"Consider standard treatment in vulnerable patients with reversible impairments (after 
resolution of geriatric problems) similar to fit patients, if life expectancy is > 10 years.",Weak
