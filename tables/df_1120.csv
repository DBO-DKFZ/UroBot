4.1.4.3.1.1 Summary of evidence and recommendations for bladder wall injection of onabotulinumtoxinA,
Summary of evidence,LE
"A single treatment session of onabotA (100 U) injected in the bladder wall is more effective than 
placebo at curing and improving UUI/OAB symptoms and improving QoL.",1a
"There is no evidence that repeated injections of onabotA have reduced efficacy, but discontinuation 
rates are high.",2a
"There is a risk of voiding dysfunction, increased PVR volume and UTI with onabotA injections.",1a
"The risk of bacteriuria after onabotA (100 U) injection is high but the clinical significance of this 
remains uncertain.",1b
"OnabotulinumtoxinA is more effective in curing UUI but similarly effective in reducing mean UUI 
episodes compared with antimuscarinics.",1a
OnabotulinumtoxinA is associated with higher rates of voiding dysfunction than antimuscarinics.,1a
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer bladder wall injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (100 U) to patients with OAB/UUI 
refractory to conservative therapy or drug treatment.",Strong
"Warn patients of the limited duration of response, risk of UTI and possible prolonged 
need for clean intermittent self-catheterisation prior to offering treatment with 
onabotulinumtoxinA.",Strong
