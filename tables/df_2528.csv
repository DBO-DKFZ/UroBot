nephrectomy.",1b,,,,,

Adjuvant pembrolizumab defined by the inclusion criteria of the trial* after nephrectomy improves DFS.,1b,,,,,
Adjuvant PD-L1 inhibition with atezolizumab did not improve DFS or OS.,1b,,,,,
Adjuvant dual PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition with nivolumab and ipilimumab did not improve DFS.,1b,,,,,
