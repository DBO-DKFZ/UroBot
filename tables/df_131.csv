HPV-independent SCC,,,
Usual,45 – 75,20 – 38,Diagnosis of exclusion. Various degrees of differentiation
Pseudohyperplastic*,< 1,0,"Well-differentiated, superficially spreading simulating 
pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia"
Pseudoglandular*,< 1,30,"Poorly-differentiated carcinoma with acantholytic 
pseudolumina simulating glands"
Verrucous,3 – 8,0,"Extremely well-differentiated, broad-based, and pushing 
tumour front. No metastasis reported"
Cuniculatum,< 1,0,"Endophytic labyrinthine growth pattern with broad-based 
pushing margins."
Papillary,2 – 15,0 – 6,"Papillae covered by well- to moderately differentiated cells 
without koilocytes"
Sarcomatoid,1 -7,45 – 90,"Biphasic epithelial and spindle cell neoplasia. Most 
aggressive and worse prognosis."
Mixed,10 – 19,3 – 7,"Two or more subtypes in the same specimen. Prognosis is 
related to the subtypes involved."
HPV-associated,,,
Basaloid,4 – 10,21 – 67,"Uniform basaloid cells in nests or sheets, with 
comedonecrosis or abrupt keratinisation."
Warty,5 – 10,0 – 10,"Condylomatous papillae with central fibrovascular cores and 
koilocytes."
Clear cell,< 1,20 – 30,"Nests or sheets of cells with ample, clear cytoplasm with 
central of geographical necrosis."
"Lymphoepithelioma-
like",< 1,Unknown,"Poorly differentiated cells intermixed with dense 
lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic infiltrate."
Mixed,4 - 10,30 - 50,Mainly Warty-basaloid carcinoma according to the WHO 2022.
