Summary of evidence,LE,,,
The best results are obtained after the 1st urethroplasty.,4,,,
"The overall stricture-free rate after EPA is 85.7%. By using the progressive perineal approach, a 
combined transpubic abdomino-perineal approach is usually not needed.",3,,,
"After failed endoluminal treatment, EPA is the standard treatment for a non-obliterative stenosis.",3,,,
"Both a midline and inverted U perineal incision equally gain access to the posterior urethra, but a 
midline incision is associated with less anatomical damage to local vessels and nerves, reduced risk 
of surgical site infection and hospital stay.",2b,,,
"Total pubectomy during transpubic abdomino-perineal reconstruction has a higher complication rate 
(bleeding, pelvic instability, dead space) compared to partial (superior or inferior) pubectomy with no 
gain in surgical exposure.",4,,,
"By using the progressive perineal approach, a combined transpubic abdomino-perineal approach 
is usually not needed except for very long distraction defects and in case of complicated situations, 
which include associated para-urethral bladder base fistula, trauma-related recto-urethral fistula, and 
bladder neck injury.",3,,,
"If the urethra cannot be anastomosed in a tension-free fashion or in case of ischaemic narrowing/
necrosis of the bulbar urethra, options are a tubed preputial island flap, staged buccal mucosa graft 
urethroplasty with flap, staged buccal mucosa dartos flap, radial forearm free flap urethroplasty or 
entero-urethroplasty.",3,,,
"In case of excessive dead space after resection of the fibrosis, local flaps have been advised to fill up 
this space and support the anastomosis. These flaps are also useful to separate the suture lines in 
case of a concomitant recto-urethral fistula.",3,,,
Recommendations,Strength rating,,,
"Perform open reconstruction for post-traumatic posterior stenosis only in high-volume 
centres.",Weak,,,
"Perform progressive perineal excision and primary anastomosis (EPA) for obliterative 
stenosis.",Strong,,,
"Perform progressive perineal EPA for non-obliterative stenosis after failed endoluminal 
treatment.",Strong,,,
Perform a midline perineal incision to gain access to the posterior urethra.,Strong,,,
Do not perform total pubectomy during abdomino-perineal reconstruction.,Strong,,,
"Reserve abdomino-perineal reconstruction for complicated situations including very long 
distraction defect, para-urethral bladder base fistula, trauma-related recto-urethral fistula, 
and bladder neck injury.",Weak,,,
"Perform another urethroplasty after 1st failed urethroplasty in motivated patients not willing 
to accept palliative endoluminal treatments or urinary diversion.",Weak,,,
"Use a local tissue flap to fill up excessive dead space or after correction of a concomitant 
recto-urethral fistula.",Weak,,,
