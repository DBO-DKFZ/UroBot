"2022 recommendation: Take a biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder neck 
tumour, if bladder carcinoma in situ is present or suspected, if there is positive cytology or 
urinary molecular marker test without evidence of tumour in the bladder, or if abnormalities 
of the prostatic urethra are visible. If biopsy is not performed during the initial procedure, it 
should be completed at the time of the second resection.",Strong
"Revised 2023 recommendation: Take a biopsy of the prostatic urethra in cases of bladder 
neck tumour, if there is positive cytology or urinary molecular marker test without evidence 
of tumour in the bladder, or if abnormalities of the prostatic urethra are visible. If biopsy is 
not performed during the initial procedure, it should be performed at the time of the second 
resection.",Strong
"2022 recommendation: Take a prostatic urethral biopsy from the pre-collicular area (between 
the 5 and 7 o’clock position) using a resection loop. In case any abnormal-looking areas in 
the prostatic urethra are present at this time, these need to be biopsied as well.",Weak

"2022 recommendation: The TURB record must describe tumour location, appearance, size 
and multifocality, all steps of the procedure, as well as extent and completeness of resection.",Weak
"Revised 2023 recommendation: The TURB record must describe tumour location, 
appearance, size and multifocality, all steps of the procedure, extent, macroscopic 
completeness of resection as well as any complications.",Strong

"2022 recommendation: In patients with tumours presumed to be at low risk and in those 
with small papillary recurrences (presumably Ta LG/G1) detected more than one year after 
previous TURB, offer one immediate chemotherapy instillation.",Strong
"Revised 2023 recommendation: In patients with tumours presumed to be at low risk and in 
those with small papillary recurrences (presumably Ta LG/G1) detected more than one year 
after previous TURB, offer one immediate single chemotherapy instillation.",Strong
"New 2023 recommendation: Offer post-operative saline or water continuous irrigation of the 
bladder to patients who cannot receive a single instillation of chemotherapy.",Strong
"New 2023 recommendation: Patients with small recurrent low grade Ta tumours can be 
effectively and safely offered office fulguration.",Strong
"New 2023 recommendation: Only offer active surveillance to selected patients with presumed 
low-risk tumours not amendable to endoscopic ablation.",Strong
"2022 recommendation: In patients with intermediate-risk tumours (with or without immediate 
instillation), offer one-year full- dose Bacillus Calmette- Guérin (BCG) treatment (induction 
plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months), or instillations of chemotherapy (the 
optimal schedule is not known) for a maximum of one year. 
The final choice should be made in a shared decision-making process with the patient, 
reflecting his/her risk of recurrence and progression, as well as the efficacy and side effects 
of each treatment modality.",Strong

(induction plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6 and 12 months), or instillations of chemotherapy

one to 3 years (induction plus 3-weekly instillations at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months), 
is indicated. The additional beneficial effect of the second and third years of maintenance 
should be weighed against its added costs, side effects and problems connected with BCG 
shortages. Immediate radical cystectomy (RC) may also be discussed with the patient.",Strong
