"4.2.4.2.2	 Duloxetine
Duloxetine inhibits the presynaptic reuptake of neurotransmitters, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and 
noradrenaline (NE). 
In the sacral spinal cord, an increased concentration of 5-HT and NE in the synaptic cleft increases 
stimulation of 5-HT and NE receptors on the pudendal motor neurons, which in turn increases the resting tone 
and contraction strength of the urethral striated sphincter.",
Recommendations,Strength rating

unresponsive to other conservative treatments and who want to avoid invasive treatment, 
counselling carefully about the risk of adverse events.",Strong
"Duloxetine should be initiated and withdrawn using dose titration because of the high risk of 
adverse events.",Strong
