Lymphocele
Lymphocele is a relatively common (1-26%) complication [196]. There is a significant aetiological association 
with diabetes, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (i.e. sirolimus) therapy, and acute rejection 
[197]. For large and symptomatic lymphocele, laparoscopic fenestration is associated with the lowest overall 
recurrence (8%) and complication (14%) rate compared to open surgery and aspiration therapy [198]. 
Placement of a percutaneous drain (i.e. Pig-Tail) is an option with a success rate as high as 50% [163]. 
Percutaneous aspiration can be performed although the recurrence rate can be as high as 95% [198], with an 
increased risk of local infection (6-17%) [198]. Furthermore, sclerosant agents such as ethanol, fibrin sealant, 
gentamicin, or octreotide reduce the recurrence rate compared to simple aspiration [198, 199].",
