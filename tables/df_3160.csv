Summary of evidence,LE
Sexual symptoms are the most specific symptoms associated with LOH.,1a
"Diagnosis of LOH should be based on specific signs and symptoms of androgen deficiency, together 
with consistently low serum testosterone levels.",1a
12 nmol/L total testosterone (3.5 ng/mL) represents a reliable threshold to diagnose LOH.,1a
"Functional hypogonadism is a consequence of comorbidity/concomitant drugs, which can impair 
testosterone production in adulthood. The diagnosis of functional hypogonadism is a diagnosis of 
exclusion, after ruling out organic causes of hypogonadism.",4
