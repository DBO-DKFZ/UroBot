Mycophenolates (MPA)
The mycophenolates, MMF and EC-MPS, are based on mycophenolic acid, which inhibits inosine 
monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) [283-287]. This is the rate-limiting step for the synthesis of guanosine 
monophosphate in the de novo purine pathway. As the function and proliferation of lymphocytes is more 
dependent on de novo purine nucleotide synthesis compared to other cell types, IMPDH inhibitors may provide 
more specific lymphocyte-targeted immunosuppression. The co-administration of MPA with prednisolone and 
CNI has resulted in a profound reduction of biopsy-proven rejections [242, 245, 283-287]. Mycophenolic acid is 
not nephrotoxic; however, it inhibits bone marrow function and may cause CMV infections and gastrointestinal 
side effects, particularly diarrhoea [242, 245, 283-287]. There is also a higher incidence of polyoma 
nephropathy, especially when mycophenolate is combined with tacrolimus [288].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Use calcineurin inhibitors for rejection prophylaxis as they represent current best practice 
pending publication of long-term results using newer agents.",Strong
Use tacrolimus as first-line calcineurin inhibitor due to its higher efficacy.,Strong
"Monitor blood-levels of both cyclosporine and tacrolimus to allow appropriate dose 
adjustment of calcineurin inhibitors.",Strong
