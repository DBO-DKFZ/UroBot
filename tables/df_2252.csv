"6.5.11.2.2	 RANK ligand inhibitors
Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear 
factor κ-B ligand), a key mediator of osteoclast formation, function, and survival. In M0 CRPC, denosumab 
has been associated with increased bone-metastasis-free survival compared to placebo (median benefit: 
 
4.2 months, HR: 0.85, p = 0.028) [1262]. This benefit did not translate into a survival difference (43.9 compared 
to 44.8 months, respectively) and neither the FDA or the EMA have approved denosumab for this indication [1270].
The efficacy and safety of denosumab (n = 950) compared with zoledronic acid (n = 951) in 
patients with mCRPC was assessed in a phase III trial. Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying 
or preventing SREs as shown by time to first on-study SRE (pathological fracture, radiation or surgery to 
bone, or spinal cord compression) of 20.7 vs. 17.1 months, respectively (HR: 0.82, p = 0.008). Both urinary 
N-telopeptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were significantly suppressed in the denosumab arm 
compared with the zoledronic acid arm (p < 0.0001 for both). However, these findings were not associated with 
any survival benefit and in a post-hoc re-evaluation of endpoints, denosumab showed identical results when 
comparing SREs and symptomatic skeletal events [1271].",

location and extent of disease, genomic profile, patient preference, and on previous 
treatment for hormone-sensitive metastatic PCa (mHSPC) (alphabetical order: abiraterone, 
cabazitaxel, docetaxel, enzalutamide, olaparib, radium-223, sipuleucel-T).",Strong
