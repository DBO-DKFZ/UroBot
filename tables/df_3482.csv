Diagnostic ureteroscopy
Flexible ureteroscopy (URS) is used to confirm the diagnosis of UTUC by visualising the ureter, renal pelvis 
and collecting system and perform a biopsy of suspicious lesions. It is also essential for meticulous tumour 
mapping before considering kidney-sparing options for UTUC. Presence, appearance, multifocality and size of 
the tumour can be determined using URS. In addition, ureteroscopic biopsies can determine tumour grade in 
more than 90% of cases with a low false-negative rate, regardless of sample size [100]. However, undergrading 
occurs with ureteroscopic diagnostic biopsy compared to nephroureterectomy specimens [101], making 
intensive follow-up necessary if kidney-sparing treatment is chosen [75, 102].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
Perform a urethrocystoscopy to rule out bladder tumour.,Strong
Perform a computed tomography (CT) urography for diagnosis and staging.,Strong
"Use diagnostic ureteroscopy (preferably without biopsy) if imaging and/or voided urine 
cytology are not sufficient for the diagnosis and/or risk-stratification of patients suspected 
to have UTUC.",Strong
"Magnetic resonance urography or 18F-Fluorodeoxglucose positron emission tomography/CT 
(to assess [nodal] metastasis) may be used when CT is contra-indicated.",Weak
