Summary of evidence,LE,,,,,
"Considering the wide spectrum and the complexity of surgical interventions aimed to address penile 
shortness, this surgery should be reserved to high volume centres.",4,,,,,
"Suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy 
provide an objective increase in penile length.",3,,,,,
"Suspensory ligament release, ventral phalloplasty and suprapubic lipoplasty/liposuction/lipectomy are 
associated with a significant incidence of complications.",3,,,,,
"Total phallic reconstruction provides satisfactory surgical and functional outcomes in men with 
micropenis.",3,,,,,
