"6.3.2.3.3	 Risk factors
There is a lot effort in identifying risk factors affecting the success rate of urethroplasties.
The evidence is not clear about age, obesity, aetiology or prior radiation or prior surgery. The only clear risk 
factors in multivariate analysis are the length and the site of the stricture, success rates are better in shorter or 
bulbar strictures and worse in longer or penile strictures [317, 344-346]. Patient should be informed about the 
higher risk in longer and penile strictures.",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer staged urethroplasty to men with complex anterior urethral stricture disease not 
suitable for single stage urethroplasty and who are fit for reconstruction.",Weak
"Do not perform staged bulbar urethroplasty for lichen sclerosis if single stage urethroplasty 
is possible.",Weak
"Consider staged procedure in patients unsure about perineal urethrostomy versus urethral 
reconstruction.",Weak
Warn men that staged urethroplasty may comprise more than two stages.,Weak
