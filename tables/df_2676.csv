Treatment of antibody mediated rejection (ABMR)
Treatment of ABMR relies mainly on retrospective studies and empirical treatment guidelines [367]. Consensus 
is that it is important to classify the clinical and histological phenotype of the rejection in order to make 
adequate treatment decisions [367]. Important clinical factors are time of rejection (early acute < 30 days 
 
post-transplant vs. late), preformed vs. de novo donor-specific antibodies (DSA), and histology (active vs. 
chronic rejection).",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Regular long-term follow-up by experienced transplant physicians is essential in order to detect 
complications or graft dysfunction early and reassure adherence to the immunosuppressive regimen.",4
"Annual screening should include a dermatological examination, cardiovascular history and exam, 
tumour screening (including a nodal examination, faecal occult screening, chest x-ray, gynaecological 
and urological examination), and an abdominal US, including US of the native and transplanted kidney. 
If appropriate, further diagnostic tests should be prompted to treat or slow down the progression of 
any identified complication.",4
"In patients diagnosed early with IF/TA, particularly if there is evidence for CNI toxicity, disease 
progression may be slowed by conversion to a CNI-free regimen. If the risk of rejection seems too 
high, another option is substantial reduction of CNI under the protection of MPA.",1
"Supportive measures should aim to adequately treat the consequences of chronic kidney disease (e.g. 
anaemia, acidosis, bone disease).",4
