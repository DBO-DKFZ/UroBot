Strength rating",,,,,,
Recommendations for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy,,,,,,
"Offer monitoring, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), to EAU Low-Risk BCR patients.  Weak",,,,,,
"Offer early salvage intensity-modulated radiotherapy/volumetric arc radiation therapy plus 
image-guided radiotherapy to men with two consecutive PSA rises.",Strong,,,,,
"A negative positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan should not 
delay salvage radiotherapy (SRT), if otherwise indicated.",Strong,,,,,
"Do not wait for a PSA threshold before starting treatment. Once the decision for SRT has 
been made, SRT (at least 64 Gy) should be given as soon as possible.",Strong,,,,,
Offer hormonal therapy in addition to SRT to men with BCR.,Weak,,,,,
Recommendations for BCR after radiotherapy,,,,,,
"Offer monitoring, including PSA to EAU Low-Risk BCR patients.",Weak,,,,,
"Only offer salvage radical prostatectomy (RP), brachytherapy, stereotactic body 
radiotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound, or cryosurgical ablation to highly selected 
patients with biopsy-proven local recurrence within a clinical trial setting or well-designed 
prospective cohort study undertaken in experienced centres.",Strong,,,,,
