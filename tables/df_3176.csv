Diagnostic evaluation
The aim of the initial evaluation is to obtain information on the presenting symptoms and their duration (e.g., 
pain on erection, palpable nodules, deformity, length and girth and erectile function). It is important to obtain 
information on the distress caused by the symptoms and the potential risk factors for ED and PD. A disease-
specific questionnaire (Peyronie’s disease questionnaire [PDQ]) has been developed for use in clinical practice 
and trials. Peyronie’s disease questionnaire measures three domains, including psychological and physical 
symptoms, penile pain and symptom bother [1068].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Peyronie’s disease (PD) is a connective tissue disorder, characterised by the formation of a fibrotic 
lesion or plaque in the tunica albuginea, which may lead to penile deformity.",2b
"The contribution of associated co-morbidity or risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, lipid 
abnormalities and Dupuytren’s contracture) to the pathophysiology of PD is still unclear.",3
"Two phases of the disease can be distinguished. The first phase is the active inflammatory phase 
(acute phase - painful erections, nodule/plaque), and the second phase is the fibrotic/calcifying phase 
(chronic or stable phase) with formation of hard palpable plaques (disease stabilisation).",2b
"Spontaneous resolution is uncommon (3-13%) and most patients experience disease progression 
(21-48%) or stabilisation (36-67%). Pain is usually present during the early stages of the disease, but 
tends to resolve with time in 90% of men within 12 months of onset.",2a
