Table 4.5.1: Summary of key points for penile fracture and testicular trauma,
Summary of key points:,
Penile fracture,
"The most common causes of penile fracture are sexual intercourse, forced flexion, masturbation and rolling 
over.",
"Penile fracture is associated with a sudden cracking or popping sound, pain, immediate detumescence and 
local swelling.",
MRI is superior to all other imaging techniques in diagnosing penile fracture.,
Management of penile fracture is surgical intervention with closure of the tunica albuginea.,
Testicular Trauma,
"Blunt testicular injury may occur under intense compression of the testis against the inferior pubic ramus or 
symphysis, resulting in a rupture of the tunica albuginea.",
"Testicular rupture is associated with immediate pain, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes fainting.",
Scrotal US is the preferred imaging modality for the diagnosis of testicular trauma.,
Surgical exploration in patients with testicular trauma ensures preservation of viable tissue when possible.,
Summary of evidence,LE
A concomitant urethral injury complicates penile fractures and requires specialised management.,3
"Ultrasound can determine intra- and/or extra-testicular haematoma, testicular contusion, or rupture 
with heterogeneous echo pattern parenchyma and loss of contour definition a highly sensitive and 
specific finding.",3
"Surgical treatment of penile fracture ensures the lowest rate of negative long-term sequelae on 
functional and psychological wellbeing of the patient.",3
"In patients with testicular rupture or equivocal imaging, surgical exploration can secure preservation of 
viable tissue.",3
Recommendations,Strength rating
Exclude urethral injury in the case of penile fracture.,Strong
Perform ultrasound (US) for the diagnosis of testis trauma.,Strong
"Treat penile fractures surgically, with closure of tunica albuginea.",Strong
"Explore the injured testis in all cases of testicular rupture and in those with inconclusive US 
findings.",Strong
