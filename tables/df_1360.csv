Diode laser enucleation of the prostate
Mechanism of action: For prostate surgery, diode lasers with a wavelength of 940, 980, 1,318, and 1,470 nm 
(depending on the semiconductor used) are marketed for vaporisation and enucleation. Only a few have been 
evaluated in clinical trials [385].",
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Offer prostatic artery embolisation (PAE)* to men with moderate-to-severe LUTS who 
wish to consider minimally invasive treatment options and accept less optimal outcomes 
compared with transurethral resection of the prostate.",Weak
"Perform PAE only in units where the work up and follow-up is performed by urologists 
working collaboratively with trained interventional radiologists for the identification of PAE 
suitable patients.",Strong
