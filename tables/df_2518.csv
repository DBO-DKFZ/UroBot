plus pembrolizumab, or nivolumab plus cabozantinib to treatment-naive patients 
with IMDC intermediate- or poor-risk disease.",Strong
"Offer either pembrolizumab plus axitinib, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab or 
nivolumab plus cabozantinib to treatment-naïve patients with IMDC favourable risk.",Weak
Offer sunitinib or pazopanib to treatment-naive patients with IMDC favourable risk.,Weak
"Offer sunitinib or pazopanib to treatment-naive cc-mRCC patients with any IMDC 
risk who cannot receive or tolerate immune checkpoint inhibition.",Strong

"Offer VEGF-tyrosine kinase inhibitors as second-line therapy to patients refractory

"Sequencing the agent not used as second-line therapy (nivolumab or cabozantinib) 
for third-line therapy is recommended.",Weak
