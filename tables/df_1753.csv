Recommendations,Strength rating
Urachal remnants (URs) with no epithelial tissue carry little risk of malignant transformation.,Strong
"Asymptomatic and non-specific atretic urachal remnants can safely be managed non-
operatively.",Strong
"Urachal remnants incidentally identified during diagnostic imaging for non-specific symptoms 
should also be observed non-operatively since they tend to resolve spontaneously.",Strong
"A small UR, especially at birth, may be viewed as physiological.",Strong
"Urachal remnants in patients younger than six months are likely to resolve with non-
operative management.",Strong
Follow-up is necessary only when symptomatic for six to twelve months.,Strong
"Surgical excision of URs solely as a preventive measure against later malignancy appears to 
have minimal support in the literature.",Strong
Only symptomatic URs should be safely removed by open or laparoscopic approach.,Strong
"A voiding cystourethogram is only recommended when presenting with febrile urinary tract 
infection.",
