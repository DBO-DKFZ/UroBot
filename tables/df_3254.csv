Summary of evidence,LE
"Medical/sexual history taking and physical examination are essential parts of the evaluation of men 
with a short penis complaint.",4
Among stretched penile measurements STT may underestimate erect penile length.,2b
"Among stretched penile measurements BTT has a better correlation with erect penile length, 
especially in overweight and obese men.",2b
"Flaccid and erect state measurements to assess penile length may add useful information on penile 
size.",4
Penile girth assessment may add useful information on penile size and shape.,4
"The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire, The Cosmetic Procedure Screening Scale for Penile 
Dysmorphic Disorder, The Male Genital Self-Image Scale and the Index of Male Genital Image are self-
reported tools useful to screen patients at risk for psychopathology.",2b
"Mental health counselling is helpful in detecting men requesting penile augmentation procedures 
present with strong psychological vulnerability, including BDD/PDD.",2b
"Validated questionnaire (e.g., APPSSI, BAPS, IIEF-15, MSHQ, EDITS) are helpful in assessing baseline 
sexual function and beliefs about penile size.",4
Recommendations,Strength rating
"Take a comprehensive medical and sexual history in every patient presenting complaining of 
short penile size.",Strong
"Use stretched penile length measurements (skin junction-to-glans tip or dorsally from the 
pubic bone-to-glans tip) to define penile length.",Weak
Measure flaccid and erect measurements to assess penile length in detail.,Weak
Measure penile girth in every patient presenting complaining of a short penile size.,Weak
"Use validated questionnaires to screen for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) in cases of a 
normal-sized penis.",Weak
"Use validated questionnaires (e.g., IIEF-15, BAPS) to assess baseline sexual function and 
beliefs concerning penile size.",Weak
Refer patients with suspected BDD for mental health counselling.,Strong
