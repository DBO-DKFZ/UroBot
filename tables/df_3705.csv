6.3.5.1.1	 Treatment of non-traumatic posterior urethral stenosis
Several treatment modalities including conservative management (see section 6.1 Conservative options), 
endoluminal, open or minimally invasive surgical procedures are currently available, depending on patient’s 
goals and health status.",
Summary of evidence,LE
"ReDo VUA has patency rates of 60-91% in non-irradiated patients and 67% in irradiated patients with 
obliterative VUAS or VUAS refractory to endoluminal treatment.",3
"Urinary incontinence is inevitable after transperineal ReDo VUA. Artificial urinary sphincter placement 
can be offered after three to six months if patency of ReDo VUA is ensured.",3
De novo incontinence with retropubic ReDo VUA is 0-58%.,3
