Diagnostic evaluation
3.8.3.1	
Clinical diagnosis
Signs and systemic symptoms compatible with CA-UTI include new onset or worsening of fever, rigors, altered 
mental status, malaise, or lethargy with no other identified cause, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, 
acute haematuria, pelvic discomfort and in those whose catheters have been removed dysuria, urgent or 
frequent urination and suprapubic pain or tenderness [217]. In the catheterised patient, the presence or 
absence of odorous or cloudy urine alone should not be used to differentiate CA-ABU from CA-UTI [217, 218].",
Summary of evidence,LE
"Patients with indwelling or suprapubic catheters become carriers of ABU, with antibiotic treatment 
showing no benefit.",1a
"In the catheterised patient, the presence or absence of odorous or cloudy urine alone should not be 
used to differentiate CA-ABU from CA-UTI.",2
"Microbiologically CA-UTI is defined by microbial growth of > 103 cfu/mL of one or more bacterial 
species in a single catheter urine specimen or in a mid-stream voided urine specimen from a patient 
whose catheter has been removed within the previous 48 hours.",3
