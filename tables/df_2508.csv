Immune checkpoint inhibitors
7.4.3.1.1	 Immuno-oncology monotherapy
Immune checkpoint inhibitor with monoclonal antibodies targets and blocks the inhibitory T-cell receptor PD-1 
or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-signalling to restore tumour-specific T-cell immunity 
[512]. Immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy has been investigated as second- and third-line therapy. A 
phase III trial of nivolumab vs. everolimus after one or two lines of VEGF-targeted therapy for mRCC with a 
clear cell component (CheckMate 025, NCT01668784) reported a longer OS, better QoL and fewer grade 3 or 
4 AEs with nivolumab than with everolimus [513]. Nivolumab has superior OS to everolimus (HR: 0.73, 95% 
CI: 0.57–0.93, p < 0.002) in VEGF-refractory RCC with a median OS of 25 months for nivolumab and 19.6 
months for everolimus with a 5-year OS probability of 26% vs. 18% [514] (LE: 1b). Patients who had failed 
multiple lines of VEGF-targeted therapy were included in this trial making the results broadly applicable. The 
trial included 15% MSKCC poor-risk patients. There was no PFS advantage with nivolumab despite the OS 
advantage. Progression-free survival does not appear to be a reliable surrogate of outcome for PD-1 therapy in 
RCC. Currently PD-L1 biomarkers are not used to select patients for this therapy.",
"Recommendations
Strength rating",
Treatment-naïve patients,
Offer treatment with PD1 combinations in centres with experience.,Weak
"Offer either nivolumab plus ipilimumab, pembrolizumab plus axitinib, or lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab, or nivolumab plus cabozantinib to treatment-naive patients with IMDC 
intermediate- or poor-risk disease.",Strong
"Offer either pembrolizumab plus axitinib, lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab plus 
cabozantinib to treatment-naïve patients with IMDC favourable risk.",Weak
Offer sunitinib or pazopanib to treatment-naive patients with IMDC favourable risk.,Weak
"Offer sunitinib or pazopanib to treatment-naive cc-mRCC patients with any IMDC risk who 
cannot receive or tolerate immune checkpoint inhibition.",Strong
"Offer cabozantinib to treatment-naive patients with IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk 
cc-mRCC who cannot receive or tolerate immune checkpoint inhibition.",Stronga
"Patients who do not receive the full four doses of ipilimumab due to toxicity should continue 
on single-agent nivolumab, where safe and feasible. Re-challenge with combination therapy 
requires expert support.",Weak
Sequencing systemic therapy,
Sequence systemic therapy in treating mRCC.,Strong
"Offer VEGF-tyrosine kinase inhibitors as second-line therapy to patients refractory to 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab or axitinib plus pembrolizumab or cabozantinib plus nivolumab or 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.",Weak
"Sequencing the agent not used as second-line therapy (nivolumab or cabozantinib) for third-
line therapy is recommended.",Weak
"Offer nivolumab or cabozantinib to those patients who received first-line VEGF targeted 
therapy alone.",Strong
"Treatment past progression can be justified but requires close scrutiny and the support of an 
expert multi disciplinary team.",Weak
"Do not re-challenge patients who stopped immune checkpoint inhibitors because of toxicity 
without expert guidance and support from a multidisciplinary team.",Strong
